Lester Holt,"Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Im Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News. ” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonights format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90- minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. Well explore three topic areas tonight; Achieving prosperity; Americas direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead- off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, well have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates; Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [applause]",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,

Lester Holt,"Good luck to you. [applause] Well, I dont expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and were going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, lets begin. Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. Theres been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers?",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Hillary Clinton,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together. Today is my granddaughters second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for womens work. I also want to see more companies do profit- sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. Ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under. So lets have paid family leave, earned sick days. Lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt- free college. How are we going to do it? Were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, its good to be with you. Were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What are the key components of a fair and inclusive economy that the speaker proposes to build for the future?,"Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs.

Donald Trump,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left— fired 1, 400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What actions should be taken to stop the outsourcing of American jobs and encourage companies to remain in the United States?,"Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs.

Lester Holt,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Hillary Clinton,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the worlds population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle- down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than weve ever had. I call it trumped- up trickle- down, because thats exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about whats best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and thats all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off well be and that everything will work out from there. I dont buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small- businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better well grow. Thats the kind of economy I want us to see again.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,,,,,,,Democratic,,,,0.0
Lester Holt,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. Youve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Donald Trump,"Well, for one thing— and before we start on that— my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company thats worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our countrys in deep trouble. We dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. Theyre the best, the best ever at it. What theyre doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, theyre taking our jobs, theyre giving incentives, theyre doing things that, frankly, we dont do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. Were on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell in— automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement. Its been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians havent done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton— yes, is that ok? Good. I want you to be very happy. Its very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. Shes been doing this for 30 years. And why hasnt she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact…",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What changes should be made to trade agreements to protect American jobs and address economic challenges?,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can.

Donald Trump,"Well, the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. Theyre leaving, and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, youre wrong. And once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what Im saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And thats a big, big factor.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What actions should be taken to prevent companies from moving jobs overseas?,"How do you bring back— specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?

Hillary Clinton,"Well, lets stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, “Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. ” Well, it did collapse.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,,,,,,,Democratic,,,,0.0

Hillary Clinton,"Nine million people— nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what Ive proposed and looked at what Donalds proposed, and basically theyve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle- class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3. 5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. Theyve looked at my plans and theyve said, ok, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. Thats a lot of jobs; thats a lot of new economic activity. So Ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress weve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,,,,,,,Democratic,,,,0.0

Donald Trump,"She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, Im a great believer in all forms of energy, but were putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You cant do what youre looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time theyve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt, and hes topped it. Hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven- and- a- half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because theyre not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, theyre gone. And, Hillary, Id just ask you this. Youve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?

And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and Ive said what Im going to do. Im going to have a special prosecutor. Were going to enforce the trade deals we have, and were going to hold people accountable.

So what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal to— and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together. Because we have— we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And heres the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2. 5 trillion. I happen to think its double that. Its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, Lester.

You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit. So youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesnt want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,Why is it important for presidential candidates to release their tax returns?,"You were talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.

And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns, because theres something hes hiding. And well guess. Well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding.

When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so theyre not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think its disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks its— really thinks its disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you dont learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, Im extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650— which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money. Its not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was— actually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3. 9 billion. And the $650 isnt even on that. But its not $650. Its much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would— if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. Its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our countrys a mess, you know, its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible— you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land— weve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and were a mess. We havent even started. And weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And its really a shame. And its politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Were a debtor nation. Were a serious debtor nation.

Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. Its an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnt get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Im running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thats what I do. But what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Ill give you an example. Were just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I dont get there one way, Im going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But were opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. Im a year ahead of schedule. And thats what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we dont have people that know what theyre doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.

Hillary Clinton,"Well, youre right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system. Weve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And weve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. Ive laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.

We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.

Theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop- and- frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one- half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just dont want to see it creep back up. Weve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African- American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And its just a fact that if youre a young African- American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say— we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. Im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now— and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby— right now, weve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If youre too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.

But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.

When a person is on a watch list or a no- fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which Im very proud of. These are very, very good people, and theyre protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no- fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnt be on there, well help them, well help them legally, well help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super- predator about young black youth. And thats a term that I think was a— its— its been horribly met, as you know. I think youve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop- and- frisk, you know, youre talking about taking guns away. Well, Im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I dont think— I really dont think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe theres a political reason why you cant say it, but I really dont believe— in New York City, stop- and- frisk, we had 2, 200 murders, and stop- and- frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. Its hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2, 200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.

But it cant be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African- Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.

You were after him, you were trying to— you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I dont think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work. It really doesnt. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country— it was a federal lawsuit— were sued. We settled the suit with zero— with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I dont do on you. Maybe Im trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look— I look at that, and I say, isnt that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things. Ill go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And its a tremendously successful club. And Im so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.

I know Donalds very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really… [crosstalk] … tough, long game here.

I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. Were making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And were hoping that within the year well be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.

And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10, 000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them. Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil— and we should have taken the oil— ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil— a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What mistakes did President Obama and Secretary Clinton make regarding Iraq that contributed to the rise of ISIS?,"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.

Hillary Clinton,"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. But the larger point— and he says this constantly— is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then- Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But lets talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? Thats the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think weve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So weve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means weve got to work more closely with our allies, and thats something that Donald has been very dismissive of. Were working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. Were working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. Theyre on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donalds rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,,,,,,,Democratic,,,,0.0

Donald Trump,"The secretary said very strongly about working with— weve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen. You look at the Middle East, its a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, Im a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, Ill tell you. I havent given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number two— and that bothers me, because we should be asking— were defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because— and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest— but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thats great. And I think we should get— because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Its a lot of money to protect other people. But Im all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And theyre going to do that. And that was— believe me— Im sure Im not going to get credit for it— but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.

But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in 04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely— because if you read this article, theres no doubt. But if somebody— and Ill ask the press— if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war.

Hillary Clinton,"Whew, ok. [laughter] Lets talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this; An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time its ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasnt enough. So I spent a year- and- a- half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot. Thats diplomacy. Thats coalition- building. Thats working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, Id blow them out of the water and start another war. Thats not good judgment.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,,,,,,,Democratic,,,,0.0

Donald Trump,"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their— they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B- 52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not— we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1. 7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal?
