John Kerry,"Yes, I do. But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. Youve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make American safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances. Ill never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances. This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and were now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think thats wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. All of these, and especially homeland security, which well talk about a little bit later.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What are the key differences between your approach to national security and that of President Bush?,"Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry. As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, Senator Kerry. You have two minutes. Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11- type terrorist attack on the United States?",0.89075804,0.9287287,0.77668643,0.38459212
George W. Bush,"No, I dont believe its going to happen. I believe Im going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. Ive shown the American people I know how to lead. I have — I understand everybody in this country doesnt agree with the decisions Ive made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe. And thats how best it is to keep the peace. This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. And thats what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, thatll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty. And thats what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. Its a phenomenal statistic. That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty- one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, its tough. Its hard work. Its incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. Thats why theyre fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didnt. And theyre showing up in Iraq for the same reason. Theyre trying to defeat us. And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the importance of maintaining strong leadership and resolve in the fight against terrorism and the spread of democracy?,"New question, Mr. President, two minutes. Do you believe the election of Senator Kerry on November the 2nd would increase the chances of the U. S. being hit by another 9/11- type terrorist attack?",0.8728101,0.9164905,0.7220694,0.1524173
John Kerry,"Well, where do you want me to begin? First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didnt even want to do that. And it wasnt until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said youve got to go to the U. N. , that the president finally changed his mind — his campaign has a word for that — and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. “Last resort. ” Youve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, “I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. ” I dont believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost; $200 billion — $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and its in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the worlds opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so hes got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden — than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I dont think so.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"What are the shortcomings in the current U.S. strategy regarding the war on terror, particularly in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan?","New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry. “Colossal misjudgments. ” What colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas?",0.8587339,0.9242132,0.7549479,0.28616947
George W. Bush,"Jim, weve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. Were facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, theyll strike anywhere, with any means. And thats why its essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. Thats why its essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that theres only one focus on the war on terror doesnt really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course were after Saddam Hussein — I mean bin Laden. Hes isolated. Seventy- five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer — the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison. Were making progress. But the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippines — weve got help — were helping them there to bring — to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. Thats why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. Weve got a plan to do so. And the main reason well succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. Hes a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesnt want U. S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. Were spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. Thats the plan for victory. And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"How is the United States planning to achieve success in the war on terror, particularly in Iraq?","New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What about Senator Kerrys point, the comparison he drew between the priorities of going after Osama bin Laden and going after Saddam Hussein?",0.8721498,0.91549826,0.742782,0.31811458
John Kerry,"Jim, let me tell you exactly what Ill do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but were shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America. The president hasnt put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. Thats why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadnt done the work that ought to be done. The president — 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X- rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those arent my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut — and thats who gets it — long before we do, Im going to invest in homeland security and Im going to make sure were not cutting COPS programs in America and were fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didnt want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And theres an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. Thats a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union — former Soviet Union for 13 years. Im going to do it in four years. And were going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What are the differences in priorities between the current administration and your approach to investing in homeland security and public safety?,"Well come back to Iraq in a moment. But I want to come back to where I began, on homeland security. This is a two- minute new question, Senator Kerry. As president, what would you do, specifically, in addition to or differently to increase the homeland security of the United States than what President Bush is doing?",0.90703034,0.93041104,0.8240504,0.50216985
George W. Bush,"Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And thats what were doing. Weve got 100, 000 trained now, 125, 000 by the end of this year, 200, 000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. Well never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home — which I really want to do, but I dont want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because weve achieved an objective — is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is; When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that theyre on their way to, you know, a nation thats free; thats when. And I hope its as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines wont work. My opponent at one time said, “Well, get me elected, Ill have them out of there in six months. ” You cant do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, “Thank you for what youre doing. Were standing with you strong. Well give you all the equipment you need. And well get you home as soon as the missions done, because this is a vital mission. ” A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and thats essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the criteria for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq while ensuring its security and stability?,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U. S. troops home from Iraq?",0.88386476,0.93657136,0.81461096,0.61618316
John Kerry,"No, and they dont have to, providing we have the leadership that we put — that Im offering. I believe that we have to win this. The president and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, “We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. ” He didnt do any of those things. They didnt do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said youre going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, “Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. ” Thats what we have here. And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. Theyve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this president hasnt even held the kind of statesman- like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, hes done the opposite. He pushed them away. When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, “No, no, well go do this alone. ” To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, “If you werent with us in the war, dont bother applying for any construction. ” Thats not a way to invite people.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What criticisms does the speaker have regarding the current administration's approach to the Iraq War and international cooperation?,"All right, new question. Two minutes, Senator Kerry. Speaking of Vietnam, you spoke to Congress in 1971, after you came back from Vietnam, and you said, quote, “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake? ” Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake?",0.84519005,0.9284009,0.7446931,0.3130893
George W. Bush,"No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around. I mean, we thought wed whip more of them going in. But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I thought they would stay and fight, but they didnt. And now were fighting them now. And its hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is. But its necessary work. And Im optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. Im optimistic well achieve — I know we wont achieve if we send mixed signals. I know were not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens. Weve got a plan in place. The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be. The plan says well train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are. And its not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordans helping train police, UAE is helping train police. Weve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts. And were making progress there. And our alliance is strong. And as I just told you, theres going to be a summit of the Arab nations. Japan will be hosting a summit. Were making progress. It is hard work. It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. Its hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free. But its necessary work. And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What are the challenges and actions involved in transitioning Iraq from a tyranny to a democracy?,"New question, Mr. President, two minutes. You have said there was a, quote, “miscalculation, ” of what the conditions would be in post- war Iraq. What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen?",0.8826868,0.92277247,0.76861084,0.34623033
John Kerry,"Well, Ive never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then. And I try not to. Ive been — but Ill nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people. And Ill tell you exactly how. First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didnt exist. We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didnt. He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. They obviously didnt. He misled the American people when he said wed go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference. Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. Ive worked with those leaders the president talks about, Ive worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president. And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table. And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know — Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam. We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances. I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and Im going to try to follow in their footsteps.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What are the key criticisms of the president's approach to the Iraq war and its consequences for American credibility and international relations?,"New question. Senator Kerry, two minutes. You just — youve repeatedly accused President Bush — not here tonight, but elsewhere before — of not telling the truth about Iraq, essentially of lying to the American people about Iraq. Give us some examples of what you consider to be his not telling the truth.",0.84327203,0.935233,0.7999182,0.35762358
George W. Bush,"You know, every life is precious. Every life matters. You know, my hardest — the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harms way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife. You know, I think about Missy Johnson. Shes a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina. She and her son Bryan, they came to see me. Her husband PJ got killed. Hed been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq. You know, its hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harms way. I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husbands sacrifice was noble and worthy. Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror. I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide. We must deal with threats before they fully materialize. And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom. Missy understood that. Thats what she told me her husband understood. So you say, “Was it worth it? ” Every life is precious. Thats what distinguishes us from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think its worth it, Jim. I think its worth it, because I think — I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world thats desperate for freedom. It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the justification for committing troops to conflict zones despite the personal sacrifices involved?,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. Has the war in Iraq been worth the cost of American lives, 1, 052 as of today?",0.89129084,0.9204726,0.7525459,0.23534332
John Kerry,"The time line that Ive set out — and again, I want to correct the president, because hes misled again this evening on what Ive said. I didnt say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that Ive set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesnt have long- term designs on it. As I understand it, were building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you dont guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, “Wow, maybe theyre interested in our oil. ” Now, the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. Youve got to show youre serious in that regard. But youve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement; The United States of America has no long- term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But thats how were going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they havent done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards. “Oops, we havent done the job. We have to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training? ”",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the proposed strategy for reducing U.S. troop presence in Iraq while ensuring stability and addressing regional concerns?,"Speaking of your plan, new question, Senator Kerry. Two minutes. Can you give us specifics, in terms of a scenario, time lines, et cetera, for ending major U. S. military involvement in Iraq?",0.8697115,0.9332223,0.82582974,0.46329093
George W. Bush,"I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. Never wanted to commit troops. When I was running — when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt Id be doing that. But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely well ever have to use troops. But a president must always be willing to use troops. It must — as a last resort. I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, “Let the inspectors work, or lets, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, ” he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. Theres just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And I would hope to never have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, weve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it. So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"Under what circumstances would the use of military force be considered, and how can diplomacy be prioritized to avoid such actions?","Mr. President, new question. Two minutes. Does the Iraq experience make it more likely or less likely that you would take the United States into another preemptive military action?",0.859186,0.9162865,0.74594414,0.36096954
John Kerry,"The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War. And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control. No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America. But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why youre doing what youre doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations. I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle. And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, “Here, let me show you the photos. ” And DeGaulle waved them off and said, “No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me. ” How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what weve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous — Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I dont know yet. But Ill tell you this; As president, Ill never take my eye off that ball. Ive been fighting for proliferation the entire time — anti- proliferation the entire time Ive been in the Congress. And weve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"What is the importance of maintaining the United States' credibility and leadership in global affairs, particularly regarding the right to preemptive strikes?","New question.

George W. Bush,"North Korea, first, I do. Let me say — I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear- weapons- free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And Chinas a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, hes not only doing injustice to America, hed be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. Its not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. Thatâ€™s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five- nation coalition thats sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. Theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And weve got a good strategy.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the approach of the United States regarding negotiations with North Korea and Iran about their nuclear ambitions?,"New question, Mr. President.

John Kerry,"Well, Ill tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran. Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is — one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today; people with stop- loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. Its a moral responsibility for us and the world.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the rationale for the United States taking a more active role in addressing the genocide in Darfur and supporting the African Union?,"New question, two minutes. Senator Kerry, you mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan. Fifty thousand people have already died in that area. More than a million are homeless. And its been labeled an act of ongoing genocide. Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops. Why not?",0.8425948,0.9370207,0.7922055,0.43195352
George W. Bush,"Thats a loaded question. Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerrys service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad. I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning. I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate. Although Im not so sure I admire the record. I wont hold it against him that he went to Yale. Theres nothing wrong with that. My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, Ive been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And thats my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U. S. president. Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What are the concerns about Senator Kerry's consistency and leadership in relation to the war in Iraq?,"New question, President Bush. Clearly, as we have heard, major policy differences between the two of you. Are there also underlying character issues that you believe, that you believe are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as commander in chief of the United States?",0.9026232,0.9390695,0.86249125,0.6205964
John Kerry,"Nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation. Theres some 600- plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, itll take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago — six, seven years ago — called “The New War, ” which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you cant cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker- busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesnt make sense. You talk about mixed messages. Were telling other people, “You cant have nuclear weapons, ” but were pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president. Im going to shut that program down, and were going to make it clear to the world were serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And were going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And were going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty. Its our generations equivalent. And I intend to get it done.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What steps should the United States take to effectively address nuclear proliferation and secure nuclear materials?,"New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry. If you are elected president, what will you take to that office thinking is the single most serious threat to the national security to the United States?",0.8592967,0.9102497,0.756961,0.42301935
George W. Bush,"No, I dont think its ok, and said so publicly. I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, hes sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesnt believe in checks and balances, and I told him that. I mean, hes also a strong ally in the war on terror. He is — listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids. Thats the nature of the enemy, by the way. Thats why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice. Thats precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well. Ive got a good relation with Vladimir. And its important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes. I found that, in this world, that its important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, youre able to disagree in a way that is effective. And so Ive told him my opinion. I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices. And I think its very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams. And I will continue working with him over the next four years.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"What is the significance of maintaining checks and balances in a democracy, and how does it relate to U.S. relations with Russia?","All right. Mr. President, this is the last question. And two minutes. Its a new subject — new question, and it has to do with President Putin and Russia. Did you misjudge him or are you — do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is ok?",0.84278226,0.92969984,0.74898756,0.38640743
