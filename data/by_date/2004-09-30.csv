Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the University of Miami Convocation Center in Coral Gables, Florida. Im Jim Lehrer of “The NewsHour” on PBS. And I welcome you to the first of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them. The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security, but the specific subjects were chosen by me, the questions were composed by me, the candidates have not been told what they are, nor has anyone else. For each question there can only be a two- minute response, a 90- second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means times up. There is also a backup buzzer system if needed. Candidates may not direct a question to each other. There will be two- minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they will remain absolutely silent for the next 90 minutes, except for now, when they join me in welcoming President Bush and Senator Kerry. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
Jim Lehrer,"Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry. As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, Senator Kerry. You have two minutes. Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11- type terrorist attack on the United States?",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
John Kerry,"Yes, I do. But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. Youve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make American safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances. Ill never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances. This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and were now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think thats wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. All of these, and especially homeland security, which well talk about a little bit later.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is your plan to improve America's security and strengthen alliances compared to President Bush's approach?,"Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry.

George W. Bush,"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, whove suffered a lot. September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi- pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy- five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know were after them. Weve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, youre equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A. Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, were pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Republican,

George W. Bush,"No, I dont believe its going to happen. I believe Im going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. Ive shown the American people I know how to lead. I have — I understand everybody in this country doesnt agree with the decisions Ive made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe. And thats how best it is to keep the peace. This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. And thats what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, thatll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty. And thats what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. Its a phenomenal statistic. That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty- one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, its tough. Its hard work. Its incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. Thats why theyre fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didnt. And theyre showing up in Iraq for the same reason. Theyre trying to defeat us. And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What is the United States' obligation in combating ideologies of hate and ensuring global security?,"New question, Mr. President, two minutes.

John Kerry,"I believe in being strong and resolute and determined. And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim. And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. Im proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race; former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhowers son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father — all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal; Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didnt use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. Thats wrong.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Democratic,
Jim Lehrer,"New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry. “Colossal misjudgments. ” What colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas?",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
John Kerry,"Well, where do you want me to begin? First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didnt even want to do that. And it wasnt until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said youve got to go to the U. N. , that the president finally changed his mind — his campaign has a word for that — and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. “Last resort. ” Youve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, “I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. ” I dont believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost; $200 billion — $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and its in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the worlds opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so hes got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden — than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I dont think so.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What were the key misjudgments made by the President regarding the war in Iraq and how did they impact U.S. military focus and resources?,"New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry. “Colossal misjudgments. ” What colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas?",0.9555414319038391,0.938323974609375,0.8592193722724915,0.5535204410552979,Democratic,Why did the president prioritize military action in Iraq over addressing the situation in Afghanistan?
Jim Lehrer,"Ninety- second response, Mr. President.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
George W. Bush,"My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president. I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harms way. Its the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didnt need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. They passed the resolution that said, “Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. ” I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasnt going to work. Thats kind of a pre- September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping wed turn away. But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action. We did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Republican,
Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What about Senator Kerrys point, the comparison he drew between the priorities of going after Osama bin Laden and going after Saddam Hussein?",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
George W. Bush,"Jim, weve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. Were facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, theyll strike anywhere, with any means. And thats why its essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. Thats why its essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that theres only one focus on the war on terror doesnt really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course were after Saddam Hussein — I mean bin Laden. Hes isolated. Seventy- five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer — the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison. Were making progress. But the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippines — weve got help — were helping them there to bring — to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. Thats why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. Weve got a plan to do so. And the main reason well succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. Hes a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesnt want U. S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. Were spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. Thats the plan for victory. And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,"What is the strategy for achieving success in the war on terror, particularly concerning Iraq and global alliances?","New question, Mr. President.

Jim Lehrer,"Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
John Kerry,"The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq. And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You dont take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace. You dont send troops to war without the body armor that they need. Ive met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where theyre going out on the Internet to get the state- of- the- art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present. I think thats wrong. Humvees — 10, 000 out of 12, 000 Humvees that are over there arent armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they dont have the armament. This president just — I dont know if he sees whats really happened over there. But its getting worse by the day. More soldiers killed in June than before. More in July than June. More in August than July. More in September than in August. And now we see beheadings. And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and theyre blowing people up. And we dont have enough troops there.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Democratic,

But that doesnt mean it wasnt a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden. It was. Now, we can succeed. But I dont believe this president can.

John Kerry,"Jim, let me tell you exactly what Ill do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but were shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America. The president hasnt put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. Thats why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadnt done the work that ought to be done. The president — 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X- rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those arent my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut — and thats who gets it — long before we do, Im going to invest in homeland security and Im going to make sure were not cutting COPS programs in America and were fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didnt want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And theres an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. Thats a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union — former Soviet Union for 13 years. Im going to do it in four years.

George W. Bush,"I dont think we want to get to how hes going to pay for all these promises. Its like a huge tax gap. Anyway, thats for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money were spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. Weve got 1, 000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1, 000 on the northern border. Were modernizing our borders. We spent $3. 1 billion for fire and police, $3. 1 billion. Were doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. Theres a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, weve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. Were communicating better. Were going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The Patriot Act is vital — is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Republican,

Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U. S. troops home from Iraq?",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
George W. Bush,"Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And thats what were doing. Weve got 100, 000 trained now, 125, 000 by the end of this year, 200, 000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. Well never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home — which I really want to do, but I dont want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because weve achieved an objective — is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is; When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that theyre on their way to, you know, a nation thats free; thats when. And I hope its as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines wont work. My opponent at one time said, “Well, get me elected, Ill have them out of there in six months. ” You cant do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, “Thank you for what youre doing. Were standing with you strong. Well give you all the equipment you need. And well get you home as soon as the missions done, because this is a vital mission. ” A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and thats essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.

John Kerry,"Thank you, Jim. My message to the troops is also; Thank you for what theyre doing, but its also help is on the way. I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today. You know, its interesting. When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said; We need you. Youve got to help us over there. Now I believe theres a better way to do this. You know, the presidents father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didnt is, he said — he wrote in his book — because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. Thats exactly where we find ourselves today. Theres a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didnt guard the nuclear facilities. We didnt guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didnt guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what its like to go out on one of those missions when you dont know whats around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping. Im going to hold that summit.

John Kerry,"No, and they dont have to, providing we have the leadership that we put — that Im offering. I believe that we have to win this. The president and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, “We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. ” He didnt do any of those things. They didnt do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said youre going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, “Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. ” Thats what we have here. And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. Theyve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this president hasnt even held the kind of statesman- like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, hes done the opposite. He pushed them away. When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, “No, no, well go do this alone. ” To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, “If you werent with us in the war, dont bother applying for any construction. ” Thats not a way to invite people.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,What critical leadership decisions are necessary to build a coalition and effectively address the threats posed by Saddam Hussein and the situation in Iraq?,"All right, new question.

But you cant tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8, 300, and below that the four others are below 4, 000, and below that, there isnt anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.

I said, if we do the things that Ive set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesnt have long- term designs on it. As I understand it, were building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you dont guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, “Wow, maybe theyre interested in our oil. ” Now, the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. Youve got to show youre serious in that regard. But youve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement; The United States of America has no long- term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But thats how were going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they havent done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.

It must — as a last resort. I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, “Let the inspectors work, or lets, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, ” he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off.

And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1, 000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains. With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didnt use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the worlds number one criminal and terrorist. They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. Thats the enemy that attacked us. Thats the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. Thats the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two- thirds of the country was a no- fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U. N. inspectors.

Jim Lehrer,"New question. Two minutes, Senator Kerry. What is your position on the whole concept of preemptive war?",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
John Kerry,"The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War. And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control. No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America. But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why youre doing what youre doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations. I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle. And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, “Here, let me show you the photos. ” And DeGaulle waved them off and said, “No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me. ” How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what weve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous — Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I dont know yet. But Ill tell you this; As president, Ill never take my eye off that ball. Ive been fighting for proliferation the entire time — anti- proliferation the entire time Ive been in the Congress. And weve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect.

Let me tell you one thing I didnt sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion — the difference of opinions. And that is, I wouldnt join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial. And I wouldnt join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasnt a popular move. But its the right move not to join a foreign court that could — where our people could be prosecuted. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if its not in our best interest makes no sense.

George W. Bush,"North Korea, first, I do. Let me say — I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear- weapons- free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And Chinas a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, hes not only doing injustice to America, hed be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. Its not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. Thatâ€™s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five- nation coalition thats sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. Theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it.

John Kerry,"With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they werent willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The president did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story; We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here. And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for two years, this administration didnt talk at all to North Korea. While they didnt talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this presidents watch.

In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is — one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today; people with stop- loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.

We will commit more over time to help. We were very much involved at the U. N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north- south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldnt be committing troops. We ought to be working with the African Union to do so — precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.

John Kerry,"Nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation. Theres some 600- plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, itll take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago — six, seven years ago — called “The New War, ” which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you cant cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker- busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesnt make sense. You talk about mixed messages. Were telling other people, “You cant have nuclear weapons, ” but were pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president. Im going to shut that program down, and were going to make it clear to the world were serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And were going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And were going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.

And thats why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi- prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started whats called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans- shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And weve been effective. We busted the A. Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. Its a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. Ill tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.

George W. Bush,"You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion; that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. And I dont hold it against him that he said grave threat. Im not going to go around the country saying he didnt tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Republican,
John Kerry,"It was a threat. Thats not the issue. The issue is what you do about it. The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U. N. and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didnt go to war as a last resort. Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq — $200 billion. Its not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Democratic,
Jim Lehrer,"All right, that brings us to closing statements. And, again, as determined by a coin toss, Senator Kerry, you go first, and you have two minutes.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,0,,,,,,,Moderator,
John Kerry,"Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you very much to the university, again. Thank you, Mr. President. My fellow Americans, as Ive said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. Theres no doubt, I think, about that. But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world. I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know whos the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace. And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world theyre going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you; I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States. But I have a difference with this president. I believe when were strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. Im not talking about leaving. Im talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. Thats the country that Im going to fight for. And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve. Thank you. And God bless America.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Democratic,

George W. Bush,"Thank you very much tonight, Jim. Senator. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. Thats not going to happen, so long as Im your president. The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. We will strengthen our intelligence- gathering services. We will reform our military. The military will be an all- volunteer army. We will continue to stay on the offense. We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home. Well continue to build our alliances. Ill never turn over Americas national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances. And well continue to spread freedom. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that the free Iraq is in this nations interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nations interest. And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East. Weve done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years. Weve been challenged, and weve risen to those challenges. Weve climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and its a valley of peace. By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want. I appreciate your listening tonight. I ask for your vote. And may God continue to bless our great land.",Pres,2004,2004-09-30,1,,,,,,,Republican,
