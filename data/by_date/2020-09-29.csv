Chris Wallace,"Good evening. From the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format, six roughly 15- minute segments with two- minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden. ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,

Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night. So let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right and make the argument you make, and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, on the first segment you go first. Two minutes. ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply we won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all; top, top academic. Good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all; said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we just - - we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. If they had - - the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election. So they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse also. Definitely it would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,What justification does the speaker provide for their right to nominate a Supreme Court candidate following their election victory?,"Our first subject is the Supreme Court.

Joe Biden,"I - - the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. And that say occurs when they vote for a - - United States senators and when they vote for the president of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted, and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is. Because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is the president has made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that, and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance - - health insurance now, if it - - if they - - if it goes into court. And - - and the justice - - and I have nothing - - I'm not opposed to the justice, as she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went into the bench - - which is her right - - that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing that's on the court - - and if it's struck down, what happens. Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held - - pay more money because she has a pre- existing condition, a pregnancy.

Joe Biden,"We're able - - they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man did - - gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre- existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well, those pre- existing conditions; insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.

In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he - - we were insisting that the - - the - - the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then?

Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump. I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement?

Nobody is going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one is going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy - - number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500, 000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build an economy that, in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us , to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they, in fact, are weatherized in a way that, in fact, they'll - - they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There are so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that, in fact, is green.

We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And, by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn.

Joe Biden,"Yes. And here's the deal. They count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And, by the way, our military, they've been voting by ballots for - - since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that's - - and that's what's going to happen. Why was it not - - why is it for them somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest.
