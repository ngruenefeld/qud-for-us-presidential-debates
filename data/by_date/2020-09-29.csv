Chris Wallace,"Good evening. From the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format, six roughly 15- minute segments with two- minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"How are you doing, man? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,That's not a statement that implies a specific question for generation. Please provide a statement with more substance or context for me to derive an implicit question from it.
Donald Trump,How are you doing ? ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is your current state or well-being?
Joe Biden,I'm well. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,How are you doing?
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night. So let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right and make the argument you make, and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, on the first segment you go first. Two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply we won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all; top, top academic. Good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all; said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we just - - we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. If they had - - the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election. So they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse also. Definitely it would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What justification is provided for moving forward with the nomination despite any potential opposition?
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's attitude or perspective towards the discussion with the President?
Donald Trump,"Thank you, Joe. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What response does the speaker have to Joe's remarks?
Joe Biden,"I - - the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. And that say occurs when they vote for a - - United States senators and when they vote for the president of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted, and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is. Because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is the president has made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that, and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance - - health insurance now, if it - - if they - - if it goes into court. And - - and the justice - - and I have nothing - - I'm not opposed to the justice, as she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went into the bench - - which is her right - - that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing that's on the court - - and if it's struck down, what happens. Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held - - pay more money because she has a pre- existing condition, a pregnancy. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,Why should the American people have a say in the appointment of a Supreme Court nominee during an election period?
Joe Biden,"We're able - - they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man did - - gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre- existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well, those pre- existing conditions; insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What impact would the election outcome have on the implementation of health care policies regarding pre-existing conditions and insurance practices?
Chris Wallace,All right . ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"There aren't 100 million people with pre- existing condition. As far as say is concerned, the people already had their say. They - - ok. Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for period of time but a president is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So, we have the Senate, we have president - - ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the significance of the electoral timeline for the president and Senate in relation to their responsibilities?

Donald Trump,"- - during that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years, I'm elected for four years. And 100 million people - - ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the significance of the upcoming years in relation to the speaker's term and priorities?
Joe Biden,The election has already started - - ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the key factors influencing the current election?
Donald Trump,"Joe, the 100 million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care that they're very happy with. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the potential impact of proposed changes on individuals currently satisfied with their private health care?
Joe Biden,That's simply not true. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What claims are being addressed as untrue?

Chris Wallace,"Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President Biden. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Number one, he knows that - - what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any - - and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win back the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can, they do, they will under my proposal. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the key components of the speaker's healthcare proposal regarding Obamacare and private insurance?

Donald Trump,"And they're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What will be the consequences if Joe does not take action against those who may dominate him?
Joe Biden,I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party - - ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the current platform of the Democratic Party?
Donald Trump,Not according to Harris. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is Harris's stance or opinion on the matter?
Joe Biden,"- - is what I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal; the deal is that it's going to wipe out pre- existing conditions. And by the way, the 20 - - the 200 million - - the 200, 000 people that have died on his watch, they're - - how many of those and - - that have survived? Well, 7 million people have contracted COVID.

I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with favored nations which no president has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47- year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody has done it.

Donald Trump,"Who, Bernie? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What position does the speaker hold regarding Bernie?
Joe Biden,"Because he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers because of his recession, number one.

Joe Biden,Not true. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What assertion or claim is being disputed?
Donald Trump,"  but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed - - they shouldn't even call it Obamacare.

Chris Wallace,Please. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,He sends out wishful thinking. He has executive orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He has been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. He's ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's opinion on the effectiveness of the actions and plans proposed by the individual mentioned?
Chris Wallace,"All right. I have one final question for you, Mr. Vice President. If Senate Republicans - - we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here. If Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You called this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the president; it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,I'm saying ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the main point or message being conveyed?
Chris Wallace,"So my question to you, is you have refused in the past to talk about it. Are you willing to tell the American people tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster, or packing the court ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Whatever the position I take on that, that will become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're in voting now.

Joe Biden,I'm not going to answer that question because ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What reasons might lead someone to refuse to answer a particular question?
Donald Trump,Why wouldn't you answer that question? ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the importance of addressing the issue of government spending?

Joe Biden,"Keep yapping, man. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are your thoughts on the ongoing conversation?
Donald Trump,"The people understand, Joe. Forty- seven years, you've done nothing, they understand. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the public's perception of Joe's actions over the past 47 years?
Chris Wallace,"All right, the second subject is COVID- 19, which is an awfully serious subject so let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than 7 million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200, 000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you, is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes it to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Good luck. Two hundred thousand dead. As you said, more than 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5 percent - - we're 4 percent of the world's population - - 20 percent of the deaths. Forty thousand people a day or contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1, 000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said it is what it is. Well, it is what it is, because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning about it because he didn't want to panic and the American people. You don't panic; he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he - - we were insisting that the - - the - - the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing - - he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What criticisms are being made regarding the president's response to the COVID-19 crisis?
Donald Trump,Well ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's intent or message in the statement?
Chris Wallace,"Sir, just a minute. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"I laid out back in March exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools, it cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and out of the sand trap and your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What actions should be taken to provide necessary support for businesses and schools during the current crisis?
Donald Trump,So if would have listened to you ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What might have been the outcome if your advice had been followed?
Chris Wallace,"Wait, you have 2 minutes, sir. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"If we would've listened to you, the country would've been left wide open, millions of people would've died, not 200, 000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should've never happened. They stopped it from  going in, but it was China's fault. And by the way when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China, you don't know how many people died in Russia, you don't know how many people died in India - - they don't exactly give you straight counts, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said he's xenophobic; he's a racist and he's xenophobic because you didn't think ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the consequences of not taking decisive action in response to a global health crisis?
Joe Biden,That's unrelated to your ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the impact of unrelated matters on the current discussion?
Donald Trump, should have closed our country. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What actions should have been taken to protect the country during the crisis?
Chris Wallace,(Inaudible) it's his two minutes. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too - - it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governor - - oh, really? Go take a look. Their governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, "" President Trump did a phenomenal job. "" We did. We got the gowns; we got the masks; we made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job - - and that's because of the fake news. No matter what you say to them, they give you bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press; they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just tell you something - - I don't care; I've gotten used to it - - but I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that job. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the argument being made about the effectiveness of the actions taken by the Trump administration during the pandemic response?
Joe Biden,I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What qualifications do you have for completing the task effectively?
Donald Trump,"Well, you didn't do very well in swine flu. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What were the shortcomings in the response to the swine flu outbreak?
Joe Biden,And ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the importance of maintaining a strong society to address internal and external threats?

Joe Biden,Fourteen thousand ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the significance of the number fourteen thousand in this context?
Donald Trump,  you were a disaster. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What was your assessment of the situation or performance in question?
Joe Biden,"Fourteen thousand people died, not 200, 000. There was no economic recession. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the accurate statistics regarding the number of deaths and the economic impact in this situation?
Chris Wallace,"Let - - sir, you ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,Far less ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What does the speaker imply about the current situation or comparison to a previous context?
Chris Wallace,You made a point. Let him answer it. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"And there was no one - - there was no - - we didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy that's being - - he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home, how many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them; you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and individuals?
Donald Trump,You would have lost far more people. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What would have been the potential consequences if different actions had been taken?

Joe Biden,That is ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is your opinion on the current situation?
Donald Trump,And you would have been months late. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What would the consequences have been if the response had been delayed?
Joe Biden,And - - and by the way ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What point is being emphasized or introduced by the speaker?
Joe Biden,"  your own - - his own - - his own CDC director says we could lose as many as another 200, 000 people between now and the end of the year. And he held it up and he said, "" If we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers"" - - just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but we - - I don't trust him at all, nor do you. I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist. We trust Dr. Fauci. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What actions could be taken to reduce COVID-19 fatalities before the end of the year?
Donald Trump,"You don't trust Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the reasons for distrust towards Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer?
Joe Biden,"We - - and, by the way ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the main topic or issue being discussed?
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen - - gentlemen, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the - - two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government's own top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,Yeah. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's perspective on the importance of addressing threats to the United States?
Chris Wallace,"But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing, because people like this would rather make it political then save lives. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What obstacles are hindering the timely implementation of measures that could save lives?
Joe Biden,God. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the significance of the concept of God in human life?
Donald Trump,"It is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer. I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to. We have great - - Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the Left - - or I don't know if I'd call them left, or ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,"What factors are influencing the speed of vaccine development, according to the speaker?"
Chris Wallace,"So you're suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"I disagree with him. Yeah. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is your perspective on the timeline discussed by the other individuals?
Chris Wallace,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it's generally available, just like Dr. Redfield. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,He said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,When can we expect to receive the answer?
Chris Wallace,"I'm talking about when it's generally available, not when ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"Well, we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200, 000 a day. They're going to be ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What preparations are in place for the military's rapid deployment?
Joe Biden,This is the same man ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What conclusion can be drawn about the individual's consistency or identity over time?
Donald Trump,It's all set up. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What preparations have been made to ensure everything is ready?
Joe Biden,"  who told you, by Easter, this would be gone away, by the warm weather, it would be gone - - miraculous, like a miracle. And, by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it. This is the same man.",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What claims were made about the COVID-19 virus and potential treatments?
Donald Trump,That was said sarcastically and you know that. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,Was the previous statement made in a serious tone or meant to be sarcastic?
Joe Biden,That was ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's perspective on the effectiveness of current measures to maintain peace and security?
Donald Trump,That was said sarcastically. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What was the intent behind the statement made?
Joe Biden,"And so here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious - - every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year. But the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine, and pray God we will.

Donald Trump,You'll have the vaccine sooner than that. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,When can we expect to receive the vaccine?
Chris Wallace,"I want to pick up on this question, though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying the public health experts, quote, "" will be muzzled, will be suppressed. "" Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?

Chris Wallace,But you're saying ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Chris Wallace,  Senator Harris is saying you can't trust the scientists. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,

",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we never accomplished it. But we've never walked away from it, like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people, close your eyes, remember what those people looked like coming out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing antisemitic bile, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed. And they asked the president what he thought. He said there were very fine people on both sides. No president has ever said anything like that. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What principles of equity and equality have motivated the speaker's political involvement and concern for societal decency?
Joe Biden,"Now, second point I'd make to you is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so you could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wanted to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, you talk about helping African- Americans, one in 1, 000 African- Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African- Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African- Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did, and what he did has been disastrous for the African- American community.

Chris Wallace,"No, sir; it's his two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"So you did that and they called you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now that you have treated the African- American population, community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the - - and that's why if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time because they saw what you did. You call them super predators and you've called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have Ohio, I have everybody. Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump. I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in half an hour but they won't do it because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at every place you want to look, Seattle. They heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order but you don't. The top ten cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats and in many cases, radical left, and they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to the point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. I tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,"What is the speaker's perspective on the handling of law enforcement and crime by Democrats, especially in relation to the African-American community?"
Chris Wallace,"All right, I'm going to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury and the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, quote "" whether justice could be equally applied in America. "" do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Yes, there is. There is a systemic injustice in this country; in education, and work and - - and - - and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. The risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as president of the United States is call a - - together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers, the police chiefs and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency and when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to- - to - - to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable. And by the way, violence and response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protest is. Violence is never appropriate.

They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together.

That is a record the likes of which very few people - and you know one of the reasons I'll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like you just don't do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president, you can't be a good vice president.

Chris Wallace,"ok. The forest fires in the west are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blame the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said I don't think the science knows. Over your four years you have pulled the U. S. out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama environmental records. What do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our stand point. And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else; the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there, the whole forest burns down. You've got to have forest management, you've got to have cuts  ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What strategies should be implemented to ensure clean air and water while also supporting business interests and managing forest health?

Donald Trump,"I think a lot of things do but I think to an extent yes - - I think to an extent yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call California is burning. California is burning. If that was cleaned - - if that were - - if you have forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live - - they have forest cities - - they're called forest cities. They maintain their forest, they manage their forest. I was with the head of major country. It's a forest city. He said, sir, we have trees that are far more - - they - - they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, you know, at some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burn to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the benefits of improving forest management to prevent wildfires in California?

Donald Trump,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky  ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What was the reason behind the increase in energy prices?
Chris Wallace,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution form cars and trucks? ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper by  ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,How would reducing the cost of cars impact their safety and the number of cars purchased?
Chris Wallace,"But in the case of California, they've simply ignored  ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now - - so - - and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out but a lot of people agree with me, many people. The care has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.

But what they've done in California is just crazy. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the speaker's opinion on the measures taken in California regarding electric cars?
Chris Wallace,"All right. Vice President, I'd like to respond to the president's climate change record. But I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits. Not abolishing. But new limits on fracking, ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact when - - when our - - during our administration, the Recovery Act, I was able to - - I was in charge - - able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody is going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one is going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy - - number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500, 000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build an economy that, in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us , to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they, in fact, are weatherized in a way that, in fact, they'll - - they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There are so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that, in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no - - no relationship to - - with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest in Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More - - more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion and say, here's $20 billion, stop - - stop tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences or consequence.

Chris Wallace,What about - - what about the argument that President Trump basically says that you have to balance environmental interest and economic interest and he's drawn his line? ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Well, he hasn't drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we - - he wants to make sure that methane is not a problem.

Joe Biden,"The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What distinguishes the Biden plan from the Green New Deal?
Chris Wallace,"All right. Gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail- in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election? And what are you prepared to do over the next five- plus weeks, because it will not only be to Election Day, but also counting some ballots, mail- in ballots after Election Day, what are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election? In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"I'm prepared to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote. com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote, and what means by which they are going to vote. His own homeland security director as well as the FBI director says there is no evidence at all that mail- in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail- in ballots, like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we are going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time, and that polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will - - he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not when the votes are counted and they are all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that will be accepted. But, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's going to accept, well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter because if we get the votes come it's going to be all over. He's going to go. He can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What encouragement or guidance is the speaker providing to ensure voter participation and confidence in the election process?
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"So, when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election and if you look at "" crooked"" Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup, they came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won and even before I won, from the day I came down the escalator with our first lady. They were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And, by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You had better take a look at that because we caught you, in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, ok, solicited is ok. You're soliciting, you're asking, they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited - - they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There is fraud, they found them in creeks, they found some with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent a two and a Democrat area, they sent out 1, 000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's a nice a nice come on November 3rd, you're watching and you see who won the election and I think we are going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done. But you know what, we won't know - - we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They are not losing 2 percent, 1 percent, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost by that. They are losing 30 percent, 40 percent. It's a fraud and it's a shame. And can you imagine, they say you have to have your ballot in by November 10th. November 10th. That means that's seven days after the election. In theory, should have been announced",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What concerns does the speaker have regarding the election process and the integrity of ballots?

Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you're going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail- in voting is going to be a disaster. You say it's rigged. You said it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail- in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter of all the voters that either cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail- in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it, and are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any disputes? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"I think I'm counting at them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don't think - - I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots, I think so. Because what's happening is incredible. I just heard - - I read today where at least 1 percent of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don't like them, we don't like them. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What concerns does the speaker have regarding the validity of ballots in the election?

Chris Wallace,"But what I'm saying is, what do you do about the fact that millions of people ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot where you're sending it in, sending it back and they are saying - - they have mailmen with lots - - did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailmen selling the ballots. They are being sold. They are being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What issues are being raised concerning the integrity of mail-in ballots?
Joe Biden,There is no - - there is no evidence of that. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What evidence supports the claim being addressed?

Joe Biden,There is no evidence of that. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the basis for your claim?
Chris Wallace,Vice President Biden ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"Five states have had mail- in ballots for the last decade or more, five including two Republican states. You don't have to solicit the ballot, it's sent to you, it's sent to your home. What we're saying is, they're saying it has to be postmarked by the time - - by Election Day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes because ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What are the implications of counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day?
Donald Trump,"You're wrong, you're wrong. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What is the reason for your disagreement?
Chris Wallace,"I want to continue with you on this, Vice President Biden. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Donald Trump,"Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What statement is Chris making that is incorrect?
Chris Wallace,"No, excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem in fact over the years with mail- in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity where they missed the deadline. So the question I have come are you concerned that the Supreme Court, with a Justice Barrett, will settle any dispute? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0,
Joe Biden,"I'm concerned that any court will settle this because here's the deal, when you - - when you file - - when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to come if, in fact, you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not doubting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, said who they voted for, say it's you, that is totally legitimate. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0,What measures should be in place to ensure the legitimacy of ballots while accommodating for potential mistakes made by voters?

In Philadelphia they went in to watch. They were called poll watchers - - a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things. And I - - I am urging - - I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election.

And that's - - and that's what's going to happen. Why was it not - - why is it for them somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest.
