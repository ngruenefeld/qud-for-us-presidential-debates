Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply we won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all; top, top academic. Good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all; said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we just - - we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. If they had - - the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election. So they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse also. Definitely it would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,Why does the speaker believe their party has the authority to nominate a Supreme Court justice?,"Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right and make the argument you make, and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court?",0.7701713,0.9221981,0.80291605,0.56818247
Joe Biden,"I - - the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. And that say occurs when they vote for a - - United States senators and when they vote for the president of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted, and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is. Because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is the president has made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that, and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance - - health insurance now, if it - - if they - - if it goes into court. And - - and the justice - - and I have nothing - - I'm not opposed to the justice, as she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went into the bench - - which is her right - - that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing that's on the court - - and if it's struck down, what happens. Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held - - pay more money because she has a pre- existing condition, a pregnancy.

Donald Trump,"All right. Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him. But that's ok. I'm not surprise. Let me just tell you something, that there's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with favored nations which no president has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47- year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody has done it. So we are cutting health care ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,What specific actions is the speaker proposing to reduce drug prices and healthcare costs?,"You, in the course of these four years have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare and just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre- existing conditions five days before this debate.

Donald Trump,"If we would've listened to you, the country would've been left wide open, millions of people would've died, not 200, 000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should've never happened. They stopped it from  going in, but it was China's fault. And by the way when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China, you don't know how many people died in Russia, you don't know how many people died in India - - they don't exactly give you straight counts, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said he's xenophobic; he's a racist and he's xenophobic because you didn't think ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,"What were the consequences of the actions taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and how do they compare to the proposed alternatives?","So my question to you, is you have refused in the past to talk about it.

Donald Trump,"You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too - - it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governor - - oh, really? Go take a look. Their governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, "" President Trump did a phenomenal job. "" We did. We got the gowns; we got the masks; we made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job - - and that's because of the fake news. No matter what you say to them, they give you bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press; they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just tell you something - - I don't care; I've gotten used to it - - but I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that job.

Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government's own top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?

Joe Biden,"No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out, he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,What are the implications of a leader disagreeing with their own scientists and putting pressure on them?,"I want to pick up on this question, though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying the public health experts, quote, "" will be muzzled, will be suppressed. "" Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?

Donald Trump,"No, I think that masks are ok. You have to understand, if you look - - I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on, you know, when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but - - ",Pres,2020,2020-09-29,1,What is your stance on the use of masks in public settings?,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer.

Donald Trump,"So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong. And again, two million people would be dead now instead of - - still 204, 000 people is too much. One person is too much. It should have never happened from China, but what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. We had 10. 4 million in a four- month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the - - he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. You know, a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat- run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week - - you saw that - - we're going to up on November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands. They can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look - - and these governors are under siege - - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you've got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs, it's a very, very sad thing.

That we have to - - we're going to make this - - the federal government spent $600 billion a year on everything from ships to steel to buildings and the like.

It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people, close your eyes, remember what those people looked like coming out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing antisemitic bile, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.

The bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wanted to do is divide people, not unite people at all.
