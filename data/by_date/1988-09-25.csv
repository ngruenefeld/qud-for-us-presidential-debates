George H. W. Bush,"I think weve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie – “Crocodile Dundee. ” And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isnt a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many- point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think were all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What actions should be taken to address the deterioration of values and substance abuse in society?,"Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir.

Michael Dukakis,"Im saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention. And Mr. Bush is right – the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we dont understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, its a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, Ive outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the worlds population in this country. Were consuming 50 percent of the worlds cocaine. Doing better in the neighborhoods.

And in my state Im proud to say weve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. Were helping youngsters; were reaching out to them. And were beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and thats the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And weve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or dont pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What responsibility do elected leaders have in addressing drug trafficking and promoting drug education and prevention?,"Governor, a follow- up question.

Michael Dukakis,"Yes, Ive been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive thats balanced ten budgets in a row, Ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, Ive suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and we cant afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. Ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and Ive outlined those in detail. Secondly, weve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid to this country. Its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. Ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20- 25 billion a year, which is what weve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I dont understand about Mr. Bushs approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says hes against new taxes, although hes broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, hes going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics. (Laughter)",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What is your strategy for reducing the federal deficit while balancing the budget?,"Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?",0.8665308,0.9283837,0.8059192,0.60445076
George H. W. Bush,"I think its the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but weve got to get the Democrats – Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. Id like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line- item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy – we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is – its not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out – the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we – and the – actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isnt that were taking too little – from taxpayer – were spending too much still. And the formula Ive given you works, weve put it through a good economic model, weve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the – Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what Ive said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please lets learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What strategies can be implemented to control government spending and achieve a balanced budget?,"Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time youve proposed this capital gains cut, youve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. Youve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit.

George H. W. Bush,"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe thats the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people were talking about here. But weve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also – I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, “We cant make it. ” And I think then youre going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs – and this cost on his – is – was – I saw an estimate, Id love to know what he thinks, $35 – $40 billion – and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isnt any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. Its a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just dont want to mandate it and risk putting this – setting the recovery back.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What approach should be taken to provide healthcare coverage without jeopardizing economic recovery and employment?,"Mr. Vice President, youve said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didnt know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts. I hope he hasnt. Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think its a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, dont you? It was in 1964 and thats what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and hes wrong now. (Applause)",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,"How does the speaker defend their healthcare program against criticisms of it being ""socialized medicine""?","Yes. Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way, I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS. In – at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease. Now, Id like to now, sir, if – what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease.",0.8235437,0.92395437,0.7845827,0.34056306
George H. W. Bush,"Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They dont like it when I say that he says hes a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. Ive seen it authoritatively written twice, and if Ive done him an injustice, and he didnt say it, Im very, very sorry. But I dont agree with a lot of – most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply dont want to see the ratings on movies. I dont want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X- rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I dont think theyre right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I dont want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I dont want to see “under God” come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I dont agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I dont agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think Im more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, Id have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. Im not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where hes coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe thats not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesnt matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And thats all Im trying to do, is put it in focus. And I hope people dont think that Im questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What are the speaker's concerns regarding the positions of the ACLU and how do they differ from their own views?,"Id actually like to follow up if I may on this mention youve made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union. Youve used the phrase “card carrying” so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that youve used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950s as less than patriotic. Id like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and whats the important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?",0.8458898,0.9290377,0.7694937,0.4122585
George H. W. Bush,"I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see – when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governors wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Bakers wife. This isnt government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough. And so I think that were on the right track. I dont see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And were on the track on this one. But – and I, look, mental – that was a little overstated it. Id say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And weve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What actions should be taken to address homelessness and support mental health services?,"Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nations homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals. Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250, 000 by the government, to around three million, including working families and their children.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, I certainly hope not. And its all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isnt providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isnt it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something thats part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didnt sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non- profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, thats the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. Ive talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, cant do it all. We shouldnt expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, thats a choice we have to make, isnt it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because its so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, thats the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesnt do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. Its the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What should be the government's priorities in addressing affordable housing for low and moderate-income families?,"Governor, youve mentioned the American dream of home ownership, and its certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class, as youve said so frequently during the campaign. And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?",0.77988744,0.9256523,0.7692849,0.4568436
Michael Dukakis,"No, I dont think there is. There are two very different issues here, and theyve got to be dealt with separately. Im opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. Im also very tough on violent crime. And thats one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. Its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. Its one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7, 000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I dont favor abortion. I dont think its a good thing. I dont think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What is your stance on the death penalty and how does it relate to your approach to crime and abortion?,"Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand, even though in the minds of many people, thats also killing?",0.92183006,0.93970406,0.8438033,0.60320854
George H. W. Bush,"I havent sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the – let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And its continuing to evolve, and its evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support – rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but its much clearer for me now. As Ive seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, Im for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,"What is your stance on abortion, and what alternatives do you support?","Yes. Mr. Vice President, Id like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might. Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mothers life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions. But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?",0.8315464,0.9174541,0.74656934,0.57556224
George H. W. Bush,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs youre talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs Im talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and thats why Im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so its a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. Im for Head Start and moving that up. And Ive already made a proposal – and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I dont think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,"What is your perspective on the role of federal, state, and local governments in addressing social programs and the needs of disadvantaged children?","Mr. Vice President, Im struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. Theres an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan- Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?",0.8848249,0.9356997,0.81419605,0.4072699
Michael Dukakis,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self- sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. Thats just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he cant play little league ball that he cant go out on the ball field because hes afraid hes going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I dont think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And thats the kind of presidency I want to lead.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,How can welfare reform and targeted investments improve the quality of life for families while simultaneously saving money?,"Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed. And can you be specific about the programs not only youd reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that youd begin.",0.7644707,0.91262233,0.7215033,0.35526758
Michael Dukakis,"Of course not. Of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors- Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. Its not the length of your resume. Its your strength, its your values, its the quality of the people you pick. Its your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not youre in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didnt prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I dont believe that the fact youve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. Im ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I dont think its just experience that makes the difference. Its strength; its values.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What qualities are more important for presidential leadership than experience?,"Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters.

George H. W. Bush,"I dont think its a question of eliminating. I can tell him some Im against. A- 6F, for example. DIVAD. And I can go on and on. Minuteman III, penetration systems. I mean, theres plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, Im not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game. Im simply not going to do that. And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is. Were going to have to- the MX. Were going to have to do that. Its Christmas. (Laughter)",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What is the approach to be taken regarding strategic weapons negotiations with the Soviet Union while maintaining a strong defense posture?,"Mr. Vice President, the governor has suggested that youve never met a weapons system that you didnt like or want.

George H. W. Bush,"What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open. Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think its fine to do business with them. And, so, Im encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. — what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off. And when they have a – they a – deals that are good for us, as China started to do– the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. Im not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place- one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I dont want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all Im suggesting is lets not be naÃ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid. Look at the INF treaty. And if we havent learned from the negotiating history on that, well never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The Reagan- Bush administration was right.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What is the appropriate approach for the United States in dealing with the changes in the Soviet Union while ensuring national security?,"Well, Mr. Vice President, you said youve met with Secretary General Gorbachev, youve met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy. Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and hes promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire. So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?",0.7386459,0.93106866,0.8180716,0.4071351
Michael Dukakis,"No, theres been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, thats about a billion dollars a year. But I dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, Im for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War- Star Wars- we have to cut some place. â‰¤ He hasnt told us where. We know where theyre cutting. We know where youre cutting right now. Youre cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. Youre cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon wed have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who cant drive their tanks more than three- quarters of a mile, because they dont have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. Theyre supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they dont have enough fuel. You have to make choices. Were not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately- on Star Wars- in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13, 000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12, 000. So, weve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down. But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks. Thats- at least thats what I read. Maybe hell tell us where he stand on it tonight.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What is your position on the current research into the strategic defense system and its implications for conventional military forces?,"Yes. Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?",0.90632284,0.9357494,0.8144535,0.35785717
Michael Dukakis,"Peter, its one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. But if theres one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, its an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And thats the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do its an open invitation to others to do the same. Weve got to be tough on international terrorism. Weve got to treat it as international crime. Weve got to attack at all points, weve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that theyre working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism. Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What should be the United States' policy approach towards dealing with hostages and international terrorism?,"Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, youve both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander- in- chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists. And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?",0.76809293,0.9164899,0.77583885,0.60992396
George H. W. Bush,"Youre judged by the whole record. Youre judged by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti- terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf. Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and- about Angola- now, we have a chance- several Bostonians dont like it, but the rest of the country will understand.

But so far you wont tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages. To the best of my knowledge theres no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so. Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President, Walter Mondale, to tell the American people. Would you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him?

George H. W. Bush,"I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.

I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society were in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit- for a- work that will be productive and he wont have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal- talking about. I see a young man who is a knowledgeable- in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable- in the whole- in the race- knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And Id like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And hes kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and hell have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, John, Im a man thats been a chief executive for ten years. Ive picked a lot of people. Ive picked cabinets. Ive named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they dont, they dont stick around very long. But I didnt pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr. President, thats wrong. We shouldnt do that. â‰¤ Thats the kind of Vice President I want. He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that hell be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And Im very very proud of that choice. And I didnt pick him because he agreed with me on everything. You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is Ive picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and weve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently- which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, well destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesnt cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that its been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think its going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think its going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio- degradable plastics- plastic- gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de- icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I dont think theres anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What strategies should be implemented to address Third World debt while also supporting the agricultural economy in the United States?,"Governor Dukakis, as many U.
