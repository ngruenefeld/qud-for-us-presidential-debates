Jim Lehrer,"Good evening. On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign. Im Jim Lehrer of the McNeil- Lehrer News Hour. My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal- Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News. For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. (Applause)",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"I think weve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie – “Crocodile Dundee. ” And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isnt a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many- point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think were all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What actions should be taken to address the deterioration of values in society and improve the education of young people regarding substance use?,"Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters.

Michael Dukakis,"I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important. But its important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.

Here we are with a government thats been dealing with a drug- running Panamanian dictator. Weve been dealing with him; hes been dealing drugs to our kids. Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences. I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. Were providing that young woman with help. But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug- running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.

George H. W. Bush,"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA. I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what Im about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan- Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor – that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think its about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,,,,,,,Republican,,,,1.0

John Mashek,"Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Michael Dukakis,"Yes, Ive been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive thats balanced ten budgets in a row, Ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, Ive suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and we cant afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. Ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and Ive outlined those in detail. Secondly, weve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid to this country. Its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. Ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20- 25 billion a year, which is what weve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I dont understand about Mr. Bushs approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says hes against new taxes, although hes broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, hes going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.

George H. W. Bush,"Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I dont quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. Its not going to cost the government money. Its going to increase revenues to the federal government, and its going to create jobs. So thats one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so lets kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits – economists on the East Coast and West think its good – it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,,,,,,,Republican,,,,1.0

John Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time youve proposed this capital gains cut, youve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. Youve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"I think its the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but weve got to get the Democrats – Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. Id like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line- item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy – we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is – its not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out – the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we – and the – actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isnt that were taking too little – from taxpayer – were spending too much still. And the formula Ive given you works, weve put it through a good economic model, weve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the – Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what Ive said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please lets learn from history.

What hes proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30, 000 that were going to give to people making $200, 000 a year. Why thats more than the average teacher makes. Weve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. Weve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.

Anne Groer,"Mr. Vice President, youve said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate.

What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe thats the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people were talking about here. But weve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also – I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, “We cant make it. ” And I think then youre going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs – and this cost on his – is – was – I saw an estimate, Id love to know what he thinks, $35 – $40 billion – and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isnt any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. Its a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.

My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because theyre paying for those who arent.

Michael Dukakis,"Let me say this about AIDS. Its the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency weve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where its appropriate and where its done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.

We cant simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. Im Chairman of the Presidents Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because theres a safety factor, but I think these things – and then also I am one who believes weve got to go the extra mile in clean – being sure that that blood supply is pure.

He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war. Now, thats a certain passion that in my view its misguided passion. He – we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, “I am a strong liberal Democrat” – August, 87. Then he said, “I am a card- carrying member of the ACLU. ” That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion.

The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough. And so I think that were on the right track. I dont see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And were on the track on this one. But – and I, look, mental – that was a little overstated it. Id say around 30 percent.

The problem, Mr. Bush, is that youve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, youve have homeless families. We didnt have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. Weve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. Weve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. Thats an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But its going to take a president whos committed to housing, whos had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, I certainly hope not. And its all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isnt providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isnt it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something thats part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didnt sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non- profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, thats the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. Ive talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, cant do it all. We shouldnt expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, thats a choice we have to make, isnt it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because its so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, thats the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesnt do.

But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didnt want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.

And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. Theres an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control.

George H. W. Bush,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs youre talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs Im talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and thats why Im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so its a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. Im for Head Start and moving that up. And Ive already made a proposal – and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self- sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. Thats just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he cant play little league ball that he cant go out on the ball field because hes afraid hes going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I dont think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.

The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened Im talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature– are putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. Were putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. Weve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence. And we can do it.

Michael Dukakis,"Of course not. Of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors- Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. Its not the length of your resume. Its your strength, its your values, its the quality of the people you pick. Its your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not youre in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didnt prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I dont believe that the fact youve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. Im ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.

As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didnt hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. Weve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we dont need and cant afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make. Im for the Stealth, Im for the D- 5, Im for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. But I dont think we need these other systems. I dont think we need them to remain strong.

And when they have a – they a – deals that are good for us, as China started to do– the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. Im not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place- one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today.

And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What were talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well- equipped, well- trained, well- maintained conventional forces.

We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now.

Why the change of heart?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Michael Dukakis,"No, theres been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, thats about a billion dollars a year. But I dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, Im for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War- Star Wars- we have to cut some place. â‰¤ He hasnt told us where. We know where theyre cutting. We know where youre cutting right now. Youre cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. Youre cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon wed have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who cant drive their tanks more than three- quarters of a mile, because they dont have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. Theyre supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they dont have enough fuel. You have to make choices. Were not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately- on Star Wars- in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13, 000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12, 000. So, weve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.

Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. But if theres one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, its an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And thats the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do its an open invitation to others to do the same. Weve got to be tough on international terrorism. Weve got to treat it as international crime. Weve got to attack at all points, weve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that theyre working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.

I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society were in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit- for a- work that will be productive and he wont have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal- talking about. I see a young man who is a knowledgeable- in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable- in the whole- in the race- knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And Id like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And hes kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and hell have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ï€s and 40Ï€s and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the- lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name. My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a persons name is a little beneath this process. And hell do very well when we get into the debates. (Applause)",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What qualifications and strengths does the speaker see in Dan Quayle that justify their confidence in him?,"Mr. Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, John, Im a man thats been a chief executive for ten years. Ive picked a lot of people. Ive picked cabinets. Ive named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they dont, they dont stick around very long. But I didnt pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr. President, thats wrong. We shouldnt do that. â‰¤ Thats the kind of Vice President I want. He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that hell be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And Im very very proud of that choice. And I didnt pick him because he agreed with me on everything. You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is Ive picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much. I doubt very much that Mr. Bushs selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.

George H. W. Bush,"I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening. I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him. But now weve got the lines too carefully drawn here.

Anne Groer,"Governor Dukakis, as many U. S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,0,,,,,,,Moderator,,,,
Michael Dukakis,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and weve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently- which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, well destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesnt cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that its been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think its going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think its going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio- degradable plastics- plastic- gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de- icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I dont think theres anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",Pres,1988,1988-09-25,1,What strategies should be implemented to address Third World debt while simultaneously supporting the agricultural economy in the United States?,"Governor Dukakis, as many U.

George H. W. Bush,"I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad and thats why Ive called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so Im optimistic about the agricultural economy. In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I dont want to see the banks let off the hook. I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged. But lets not go back to that- what they call supply management and production control, thatll simply price us out of the international market.

George H. W. Bush,"I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election. Opportunity and peace. I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change but we are the change. I am the change. I dont want to go back to malaise and misery index. And, so, opportunity. Keep America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. Weve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it. I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons. I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. Weve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing. And I do favor the death penalty. And weve got a wide array of differences on those. But in the final analysis- in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, theyre going to say, â‰¥Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done? â‰¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very much.

Michael Dukakis,"This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family. Weve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. Im more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country. You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them. I believe in the American dream. Im a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America. With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families. Yes, its a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÏ€s not an insolvable problem. Its one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America thats strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because were true to our values. We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesnt hide. We compete. The best America. We invest. The best America doesnt leave some of its citizens behind. We live- we bring everybody along. And the best America is not behind us. The best America is yet to come. Thank you very much.
