Walter Mondale,"One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, theyve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether well deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that Ive heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesnt converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates — the real cost of interest — will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that were moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy thats fair. Ive stood up and told the American people that I think its a real problem, that it can destroy long- term economic growth, and Ive told you what I think should be done. I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What is the significance of addressing the enormous deficits facing the nation for long-term economic growth and recovery?,"Mr. Mondale, the Carter- Mondale administration didnt come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term. You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two- thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?",0.7430043,0.92475986,0.8245078,0.54143465
Walter Mondale,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things — [applause] — that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and Im not going to do it that way. The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7, 000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And thats why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the Presidents recommendations.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,"What areas of federal spending can be cut without affecting essential programs like Social Security, Medicare, and student assistance?","Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isnt it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?",0.82390183,0.9267415,0.7651385,0.48032105
Walter Mondale,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what Im saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long- term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes thats the case. I do, and Im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair. I think thats what leadership is all about. Theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when theres a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time — and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen — once, and sometimes twice — the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. Its the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is whats needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And thats why in this campaign Im telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,How will your approach to leadership as President address the challenges of the national deficit and security threats?,"Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the others leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondales leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government. Id like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims — Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.",0.77870977,0.9196763,0.780097,0.42205292
Walter Mondale,"Well, I think were getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What is the importance of contrasting leadership styles and values in the presidential debate?,"You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?",0.8737066,0.9122132,0.7664695,0.40356195
Ronald Reagan,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since youve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25- percent cut in Social Security — before I get to the answer to your question — the only 25- percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society — that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society. Now, having that, I think also that in leadership — well, I believe that you find people, positions such as Im in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I dont believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding whos going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job. But I also believe something else about that. I believe that — and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office — that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I dont want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people — is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue. Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they werent to be abhorred — that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What are the key principles that should guide effective leadership in government?,"Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondales campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news?

Ronald Reagan,"Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what weve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and were going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and were taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What is the government's commitment to maintaining subsidies and support for people in need?,"As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could — a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign — that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old- age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly.

Ronald Reagan,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, “born again, ” so I dont know whether I would fit that — that particular term. But I have — thanks to my mother, God rest her soul — the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I dont believe — I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not — I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer. At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign — or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondales running mate said I wasnt a good Christian. So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I dont believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,How does the speaker view the role of faith and prayer in relation to their responsibilities in office and political campaigns?,"Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born- again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?

Ronald Reagan,"The answer to your question is very simple about why I dont go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut — were supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand — but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church. I know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I dont feel — and my minister knows this and supports me in this position — I dont feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,Why do you choose not to attend church despite your lifelong commitment to it?,"Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why dont you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?

Walter Mondale,"First of all, I accept President Reagans affirmation of faith. Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I dont know if Ive been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I dont know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. Its probably the reason that Im in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think were all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use ones own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that thats a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, were going to have a religious test for judges before theyre selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think thats an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth — more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth — and its because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. Thats why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue — as I do — to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What concerns does the speaker have about the intersection of faith and politics in the United States?,"Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born- again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?",0.8457251,0.9199575,0.7577653,0.48485368
Walter Mondale,"No. What I object to — [applause] — what I object to — what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others. A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. Its when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political — or private religious faith and the use of the state is where — for the most personal decisions in American life — thats where I draw the line.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What are the dangers of using faith to impose beliefs on others through government?,"Yes, Mr. Mondale, youve complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and youve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if Im wrong, but I dont recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti- Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers whove been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?",0.72198665,0.9082421,0.7047636,0.22418836
Walter Mondale,"My answer is that this campaign isnt over yet. And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. The American people want arms control. They dont want this arms race. And they dont want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know its got to come down. And if it wont come down, the economys going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because its unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that peoples lives and health are being risked, because weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap thats widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, were all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,"What do the American people want from their government in terms of foreign policy, debt reduction, environmental protection, education, and civil rights?","After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter] Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue- collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap — the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing. Id like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans?

Walter Mondale,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says itll disappear automatically. Ive said its going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions. Secondly, Ive said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didnt happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think its going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What are the differing views on addressing the federal deficit and the proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare?,"Mr. Mondale, isnt it possible that the American people have heard your message — and they are listening — but they are rejecting it?",0.81273496,0.9082217,0.70203376,0.07179805
Ronald Reagan,"Well, again, Im running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondales running away from his. But Im running on the record of what we have asked for. Well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6. 1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago — I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one- third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with — if it did that much — with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did — 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education — on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.

I think that weve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5- year program — but its just about finished already — a billion dollars. And now were going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.

Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is — theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, its a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying — I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious — there were clerics there — everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown- up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then- Democratic Governor — signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isnt it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, thats murder? And it used the term “death of the unborn child. ” So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine — and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What is the argument regarding the legal status of unborn children in relation to abortion and the Constitution?,"Id like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences — and that is abortion and right to life.

And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do. Now, it is a sin if youre taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo- Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self- defense.

Walter Mondale,"This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, wont work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. Thats always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges whove been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I dont think so, and I think its going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We havent felt so insecure that weve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. Its been a good instinct. And were the most religious people on Earth.

I dont know the answer to when life begins. And its not that simple, either. Youve got another life involved. And if its rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If its incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It wont work.

Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1. 5 million abortions in 1980.

Walter Mondale,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70, 000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around. Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200, 000 a year got $60, 000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30, 000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. Thats why my proposal protects everybody from $25, 000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70, 000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. Hes one of the wealthiest Americans, and hes our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12. 8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And thats why Ive proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people whove already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,How should tax policies be revised to ensure fairness for lower-income individuals while addressing the deficit?,"Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle- class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, Im talking not about the rich or the poor — I know your views on their taxes — but about families earning 25, 000 to 45, 000 a year.

Walter Mondale,"The first thing is, everybody 25, 000 and under would have no tax increase. Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said hes studying a sales tax or a value- added tax. Theyre the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate- income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched. Up until about $70, 000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, Id like to see the total repeal of indexing. I dont think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What are the proposed changes to the tax system and how will they impact different income groups?,"It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25, 000 to 45, 000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25, 000 to 35, 000, their tax rate would go up — their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35, 000 to 45, 000, more than that, several hundred dollars.

Ronald Reagan,"You know, I wasnt going to say this at all, but I cant help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I dont have a plan to tax — or increase taxes. Im not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; its that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people — this is why we had a 25- percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50, 000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage- wise as did those from 50, 000 down. From 50, 000 down, those people paid two- thirds of the taxes, and those people got two- thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of 77 — this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time — there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money — virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there — that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38, 000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 — theyre paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I dont think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesnt work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as Ive said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What is the speaker's position on taxation and its fairness across different income brackets?,"Mr. President, let me try this on you.

Ronald Reagan,"Yes, I had used — “last resort” would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. I dont foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence Im not going to go for a tax. With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there — had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1- year thing with him.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,Under what circumstances would tax adjustments be considered necessary?,"I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than youve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that “Im not going to raise taxes. ” Is that what you meant to say, that you will not — that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President?

Ronald Reagan,"Well, some of those facts and figures just dont stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household — single women heads of household have — for the first time theres been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. Were spending a third more on all of the — well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before — 2, 300, 000 more are receiving them — even though we took 850, 000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half — one out of two of the full- time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low- interest college loans. We didnt think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7. 7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings — 7. 7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,What evidence is there to support the effectiveness of current poverty alleviation and aid programs under the current administration?,"Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office. There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans — working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, theyre saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies. What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term? THE",0.817409,0.9275854,0.8042756,0.56169736

I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that were finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. I did avoid, Im afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didnt even feel the pain of the recession. Were not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",Pres,1984,1984-10-07,1,"What has been the impact of the recovery on patriotism and optimism in America, and how uneven is the recovery across the country?","In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe — 5. 6 percent.

Walter Mondale,"Number one, weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed. Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities — through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I dont mind those enterprise zones; lets try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees, theyre not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which theyre found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them — for example, the disabled, who have no alternative — how theyre going to do better, I dont know. Now, we need a tight budget, but theres no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and theyre hurting. One final point if I might. Theres another part of the lopsided economy that were in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.
