Jim Lehrer,"Good evening, and welcome to the first of 3 debates among the major candidates for president of the United States, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The candidates are; independent candidate Ross Perot, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and President George Bush, the Republican nominee. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil- Lehrer News Hour on PBS, and I will be the moderator for this 90- minute event, which is taking place before an audience in the athletic complex on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Three journalists will be asking questions tonight. They are John Mashek of The Boston Globe, Ann Compton of ABC News, and Sander Vanocur, a freelance journalist. We will follow a format agreed to by representatives of the Clinton and Bush campaigns. That agreement contains no restrictions on the content or subject matter of the questions. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement. The order of those, as well as the questioning, was determined by a drawing. The first question goes to Mr. Perot. He will have 2 minutes to answer, to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from Governor Clinton and then President Bush. Gentlemen, good evening. The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other. Mr. Perot, what do you believe tonight is the single most important separating issue of this campaign?",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot. I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What distinguishes your candidacy from those of traditional party candidates?,"The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other.

Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, a one minute response.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Bill Clinton,"The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle- down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth. But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide. Tonight I say to the President; Mr. Bush, for 12 years youve had it your way. Youve had your chance and it didnt work. Its time to change. I want to bring that change to the American people. But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute response, sir. PRESIDENT",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience. I think weve dramatically changed the world. Ill talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind- boggling for world peace. Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. And change for change sake isnt enough. We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way were going to get it done is were going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. Ill sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change. But Id say, if you had to separate out, I think its experience at this level.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, how do you respond to the President on the — you have two minutes — on the question of experience? He says that is what distinguishes him from the other two of you.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Bill Clinton,"I believe experience counts, but its not everything. Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something. Ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. Thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. Ive gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. Ive touched more peoples lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else whos run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than theyre getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. Were living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute to respond.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"I just thought of another — another big difference here between me. I dont believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him. He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams. Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economys worse than it is. But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heavens sakes. Were the United States of America. In spite of the economic problems, were the most respected economy around the world. Many would trade for it. Weve been caught up in a global slowdown. We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country thats coming apart at the seams. I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are. Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting. But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didnt in the past, because youre going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people Im listening to.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, a minute response, sir.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"Well, theyve got a point. I dont have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. (Laughter. ) I dont have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime- ridden society in the industrialized world. Â But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. So, if were at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, Ive got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one. Ive got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10- minute problem. So, if its time for action, I think I have experience that counts. If theres more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, Im the wrong man.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, the question goes to you. you have two minutes. And the question is this; Are there important issues of character separating you from these other two men?",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"I think the American people should be the judge of that. I think character is a very important question. I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned — I put it this way; I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. I — well, maybe they say, “Well, it was a youthful indiscretion. ” I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating — its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. They get on me — Bills gotten on me about, “read my lips. ” When I make a mistake Ill admit it. But he has made — not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land — organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted. Some say, “well, youre a little old fashioned. ” Maybe I am, but I just dont think thats right. Now, whether its character or judgment — whatever it is — I have a big difference here on this issue and so well just have to see how it plays out. But I — I couldnt do that. And I dont think most Americans could do that. And they all say, “Well, it was a long time ago. ” Well, lets admit it then. Say, “I made a terrible mistake. ” How could you be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say — when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, “Well, Im not going to go. The Commander- in- Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era. So there are differences but thats about the main area where I think we have a difference. I dont know about — well talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What does the way a candidate has demonstrated their character say about their suitability for the role of Commander-in-Chief?,"President Bush, the question goes to you. you have two minutes.

Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, you have one minute.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person. I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. Then, make a decision. Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there. But, I think its very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years? Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government? When youâ€™re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayerâ€™s money and youâ€™re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes. So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us. Decide who you think will do the job. Pick that person in November because believe me, as Ive said before, “The partys over and its time for the clean- up crew. ” And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge —",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,

Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perots service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and whos supporting me. But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking peoples patriotism he was wrong. He was wrong. And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush. Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism. I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it. Weve had enough division. I want to lead a unified country.

Ann Compton,"Governor Clinton, can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle- income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or, at the very least, at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase?",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Bill Clinton,"The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200, 000 and above. Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down. Middle- class people, defined as people with incomes of $52, 000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan- Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes. So that is where my income limit would trigger.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,Who would be affected by the proposed tax increase and why is it targeted at this income level?,"Governor Clinton, can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle- income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or, at the very least, at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase?",0.8611176013946533,0.9313313961029053,0.8154571056365967,0.5983607769012451

Ann Compton,"– below 200, 000–",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Bill Clinton,"– notwithstanding my opponents ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200, 000 and above. Then we want to give modest middle- class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60, 000. In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper- income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper- income people. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early 60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low- income housing tax credit; a long- term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. Weve got to have no more trickle down. We dont need across- the- board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say heres your tax incentive; if you create American jobs, the old- fashioned way. Id like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I dont want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and thats whats happened in the last 4 years. Were down 35, 000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and thats what I want to do.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute, sir. PRESIDENT",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"Well, let me– I have to correct one thing. I didnt question the mans patriotism. I questioned his judgment and his character. What he did in Moscow, thats fine. Let him explain it. He did. I accept that. What I dont accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your countrys at war. Im sorry. I cannot accept that. In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200, 000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200, 000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they use– were going to soak the rich- - were going to soak the rich– it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill. And so I just have a different approach. I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people. Weve got a big difference there.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, one minute. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"Weve got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base. Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, its minimum- wage jobs. So weve got to really rebuild our job base. Thats going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that. Our foreign competitors are doing it; were not. We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. Were going to go through a period of shared sacrifice. Theres one challenge. Its got to be fair. Weve created a mess, dont have much to show for it and we have got to fix it. And thats about all I can say in a minute.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"Okay. (APPLAUSE) Next question goes to President Bush for a 2- minute answer, and it will be asked by Sandy Vanocur. SANDER",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Sander Vanocur,"Mr. President, this past week your secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut US forces in Europe from 150 to 100 thousand by the end of September 1996. Now, why, almost 50 years after the end of World War II, and with the total collapse of the Soviet Union, should American taxpayers be taxed to support armies in Europe when the Europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves?",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is; for 40- some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,Why is it essential for the United States to maintain its military presence and defense spending in Europe?,"Mr. President, this past week your secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut US forces in Europe from 150 to 100 thousand by the end of September 1996.

Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"If Im poor and youre rich, and I can get you to defend me, thats good. But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share. Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe. For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. Its kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30- billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president; when they couldnt, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They dont want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.

Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Bill Clinton,"I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made. I disagree that we need 150, 000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe. We certainly must maintain an engagement there. There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100, 000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagans former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. Were going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B- 22 airplane. Were going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply dont believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150, 000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I dont think we need 150, 000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes. He didnt tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"All right. We go now to Mr. Perot for a 2- minute question, and it will be asked by John Mashek.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
John Mashek,"Mr Perot, you talked about fairness just a minute ago and sharing the pain. As part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit, youve suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years. Why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree?",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
Ross Perot,"Its 10 cents a year cumulative. It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year. I think “punish” is the wrong word. Again, see, I didnt create this problem. Were trying to solve it. Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3. 50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we dont have it to spend. I know its not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we dont, we will be spending our childrens money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think its fitting that were on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. Weve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. Weve got to collect the taxes to do it. If theres a fairer way, Im all ears (laughter) – aah. (Laughter and applause) But– but– see, let me make it very clear. If people dont have the stomach to fix these problems, I think its a good time to face it, November. If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.

Bill Clinton,"I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think its important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one. We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit. People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people– a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years. The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists whove looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy. Thats why I think we shouldnt do it that quickly. We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work. Weve got to invest and grow. 9 Nobel Prize- winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"Your question was on fairness. I just disagree with Mr. Perot. I dont believe it is fair to slap a 50- cent- a- gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances. I dont think we need to do it. You see, I have a fundamental difference. I agree with what hes talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security. But hes talking tough medicine, and I think thats good. I disagree with the tax- and- spend philosophy. You see, I dont think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say thats going to make the problem better. And Im afraid thats what I think Im hearing from Governor Clinton. I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about; control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down. Hes mentioned some ways to do it– and I agree with those. Ive been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me thats a tax break for the rich. It would stimulate investment. Im for an investment tax allowance; Im for a tax break for first- time homebuyers. And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and Ill sit down with them and say lets get this done.

John Mashek,"Mr. President, last month you came to St. Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F- 15s for Saudi Arabia. In todays Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75- year- old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates. She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense- oriented industries into other purposes. How would you answer her.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,0,,,,,,
George H. W. Bush,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes. I think its a good decision– took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And we worked it out, and indeed were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50, 000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, youre going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that were proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is; stimulate investment and savings. I mean, weve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; were ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs Ive talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer– a little longer run; its going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her its not all that gloomy; were the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. Im much more optimistic about this country than some.

Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan. Weve given away whole industries. So as we phase these industries over, theres a whole of intellectual talent in these industries. A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and thats where the high- paying jobs are. We need to have a very carefully thought through phase- over.

The second, youve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries– have another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they dont wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schools– one on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage whove been in meetings when I would sit there and say, “Is this the one were going to talk about or do something about? ” Well, obviously, my orientation is lets go do it.

I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program. Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans. Until we control health care costs, were not going to control the deficit. It is the number one culprit. But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.

At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control. Our long- term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance. And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle- down economics– another across- the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment. But I think the important thing– the important thing– is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, were going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. That is my commitment. I think the American people are ready for action. I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them. Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done. Give me a chance to do that.

Its been very strong since Ive been president. And they recognize we got great difficulties, but theyre also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.

We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries. That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money. Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt. Whichever place you put it.

When we think of Russia, remember were thinking of many countries, now. Weve got to help them. Thats pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, weve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. Its a very unstable situation. Youve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And weve focused on the tactical. Weve made real progress there. Weve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we dont have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, weve got to be financially strong. Number two, weve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.

Bill Clinton,"I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia. But I think that its important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there. There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it. I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did– and I applaud that. I applaud the no- fly zone, and I know that hes going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it. I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing. We cant get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can. END Part 1, 1992 Debate 1 END Part 1, 1992 Debate 1",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,,,,,,
