Bill Clinton,"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100, 000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. Ive worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V- chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when theyre young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug- free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What policies should the Federal government implement to empower individuals and families in improving their lives?,"Mr. President, first question. There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?",0.8439669,0.9160015,0.7123883,0.27810794
Bob Dole,"Well, hes better off than he was four years ago.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is the current situation of his financial or personal circumstances compared to four years ago?,"Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago. Do you agree?",0.86880004,0.90660393,0.64150906,0.20564353
Bill Clinton,"Absolutely not. Lets look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Doles been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldnt work at the time. Thats what he said. Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out- of- pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole- Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Doles, even his own friends, his campaign co- chair, Senator DAmato, says that they cant possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And well have time to deal with the long- term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What are the implications of Senator Dole's proposed budget and tax plan on Medicare and Social Security?,"Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?",0.8871519,0.92823017,0.77866685,0.54370904
Bob Dole,"Well, the people need it, thats the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across — lets take a family making $30, 000 a year, thats $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that its not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, thats four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; its may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but its a six- point package. First of all, its a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. Its balancing a budget by the year 2002. Its a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. Its a state tax relief. Its a $500 per child tax credit. Its about litigation reforms. Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesnt like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think weve got a case here. And its also regulatory reform. Its a good package, Mr. President. Wed like to have your support.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is included in the proposed economic package to support families and achieve a balanced budget?,"Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think thats a good idea, the 15 percent across the board tax cut?",0.8393847,0.9076096,0.75182164,0.2821346
Bill Clinton,"Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether theyre going to support me or not. The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think thats what hes talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didnt want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldnt make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but were going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, Ill sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. Ive done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know its right for the country over the long run. Thats what Ive tried to do and thats what I will continue to do as president.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is the speaker's approach to balancing the interests of trial lawyers with the need to reform product liability laws?,"Mr. President, the Senator mentioned trial lawyers and campaign, that means campaign financing. How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns?",0.82565975,0.91355574,0.7536869,0.45162994
Bob Dole,"I think its very difficult. Lets be honest about it. Thats why we need campaign finance reform. Thats why I reach out to the Perot voters. Weve done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in 92, its all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldnt get it done, because I wasnt enforceable. Youve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. Thats how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and thats not how its going to work. But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the Presidents been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And Ive had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasnt until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent — marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesnt work that way. So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is the importance of campaign finance reform in addressing political challenges and promoting accountability?,"Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President; How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?",0.8350613,0.92470443,0.769052,0.47453982
Bill Clinton,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about whats happened. I am. But lets look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four- star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nations drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug- free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still dont understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I dont think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I dont think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isnt dangerous and wont kill them and wont destroy their lives, get the message and change.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What actions has been taken to address the issue of drug use among young people in America?,"Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs. He suggested that you are — you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States. Is he right?",0.8786437,0.9273615,0.7956119,0.63930863
Bill Clinton,"If he, thats what he said, hes not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the worlds strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things; Number one, weve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. Weve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. Weve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand Americas economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And thats one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What achievements demonstrate the United States' role as the world's strongest force for peace and security in the aftermath of the Cold War?,"Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo- op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that?",0.85272616,0.9216242,0.7403338,0.18077311
Bob Dole,"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided. Hes deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. Its cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace- keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander- in- Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position. Then Im going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now weve got a problem. Weve got to go back and look. Its just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. You may have said that, too. But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and were going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but lets do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What should be the United States' approach to military engagement and defense spending in relation to its national interests?,"Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U. S. troops into harms way.",0.83944476,0.9171729,0.73587525,0.4033691
Bill Clinton,"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban- American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms- Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though theyre effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What actions has the United States taken to promote democracy in Cuba and how do they plan to leverage international support?,"Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?",0.8942225,0.9220495,0.82225907,0.67320526
Bob Dole,"Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and well have a fairer and flatter system and were going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one- seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1. 5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. Theyre going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We wont threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum- Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. Weve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasnt satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, youre going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didnt want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, Im proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What were the key accomplishments and changes in healthcare policy that occurred during the Republican leadership compared to the previous Democratic approach?,"Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times. What do you think should be done about the healthcare system?",0.90176475,0.928856,0.79654807,0.52715456
Bill Clinton,"Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U. N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and weve been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit. I certainly didnt feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding whats called the no- fly zone by increasing our allies control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that you give him an inch hell take a mile. We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What actions were taken to address Saddam Hussein's threats to his neighbors and the Kurdish population?,"Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President. Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result?",0.8397397,0.90910786,0.6778083,0.33862424
Bob Dole,"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category? I dont know. I want to be very serious. Ive supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia. I supported him on NAFTA and GATT. So its not that we always disagree. Others disagreed with us. The Mideast is very difficult. But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before youd call somebody to America, youd have some notion what the end result might be. Now maybe its better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have started again today. But again its almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. Its ad hoc, its sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what countrys in trouble, well have a meeting. Now, to me thats not the strategy that I think people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship. Weve lost credibility around the world. Our allies know, — theyre not certain what were going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was. And I do believe that we didnt gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D. C.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What are the implications of the current U.S. foreign policy approach in the Middle East for America's credibility and strategic planning?,"Oh, No, no. I mean your charge against the President, that he has a photo- op foreign policy. Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category?",0.893749,0.9192691,0.7301222,0.539055
Bill Clinton,"Well, Im saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that. Hes troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. Thats why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And thats why weve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. Thats why were moving in the right direction. And Im trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. Thats why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. Thats why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but its got to be paid for. Thats why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future. I think Americas best days are still ahead, but weve got to build the right bridge.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,How does the speaker plan to address current challenges while emphasizing a forward-looking approach for America's future?,"Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where youre on your own, end quote. Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?",0.6898773,0.9101402,0.7800275,0.43320805
Bob Dole,"Yes. I didnt favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carters election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99. 5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, youre a Republican, you cant be reaching out to these people. Ive reached out to people all my life. Ive worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. Im not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation thats raised about $10 million for the disabled. I dont advertise it. Just did, havent before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, youre going to get to go to school because were going to match what the state puts up, and youre going to go to the school of your choice. I dont fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I dont criticize them. But why shouldnt everybody have that choice. Why shouldnt low income Americans and low middle income Americans. Im excited about it. Its going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is the rationale behind supporting opportunity scholarships for low-income families in education?,"Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.",0.85093045,0.89834416,0.6618635,0.23135
Bill Clinton,"I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3, 000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance. But if youre going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where theyre raising and spending most of the money. I simply think its wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just dont believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50, 000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. Thats a fact. Thats one of the big reasons I vetoed it.

Bob Dole,"I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies whove never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldnt be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people. Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. Weve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education. Now the reason they dont have, The reason the President cant support this is pretty obvious. Its not taking anything away from schools, its new money. Its not being taken away from anybody else, except well downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, thats what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There wont be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.

Bill Clinton,"I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so were all working together. I dont believe in discrimination. I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a government thats smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless. Its inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is Ive reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.

Bob Dole,"Let me say first, on the Presidents promise for another tax cut. I mean, Ive told people as Ive traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in 96 and not many hands go up. So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent. The people want economic reform. Theyre having a hard time making ends meet. Youve got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family. This is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. Its about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer. When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money. I think the government can do better. Are there personal differences?",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What are the key economic reforms needed to support American families and improve job opportunities?,"Senator Dole, weve talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing.

Bob Dole,"See, if I say anything its going to be misconstrued. I dont think there is even a race between the two, its about our vision for America. I happen to like President Clinton personally. Im addressing him all evening as Mr. President. I said in 1992 he didnt extend that courtesy to President Bush. But I respect the presidency. Ive served under a number of presidents. They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses. So Id rather talk about my strengths. And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. Its a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all youve got going in this campaign is fear. Youre spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator dont cut my Medicare. Im trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and thats been my career in the United States Senate. And Ill keep my word on the economic package. If I couldnt cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldnt look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America. People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word. Thats what this race is all about.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What is the fundamental difference between your vision for America and that of President Clinton in this campaign?,"Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be?

Bill Clinton,"Lets look at that. When I ran for president, I said wed cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs. Were number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said wed put, pass a crime bill that would put 100, 000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that. I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed wed moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities. I said wed get tougher with child support and child support enforcements up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I think theyre better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down. Republicans talk about it, but were the first the first administration in anybodys lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now Ive got a plan thats been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldnt take that. But well get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan Ive laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if youll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.",Pres,1996,1996-10-06,1,What achievements and results can be attributed to the speaker's economic and social policies during their presidency?,"Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Doles point that this election is about keeping ones word?",0.88771117,0.915454,0.6935212,0.3304392
