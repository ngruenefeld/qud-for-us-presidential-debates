Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. Im Jim Lehrer of the “PBS NewsHour, ” and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Jim Lehrer,"This debate and the next three — two presidential, one vice presidential — are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15- minute segments with two- minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates. The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two- minute closing statements. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent — no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Lets start the economy, segment one, and lets begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Jim Lehrer,"You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (LAUGHTER) You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weve been, but where were going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that well be better off. Ive got a different view. I think weve got to invest in education and training. I think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters — to you — which path we should take. Are we going to double on top- down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And Im looking forward to having that debate.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the key difference between the speaker's economic approach and that of Governor Romney?
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Romney, two minutes.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Thank you, Jim. Its an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. Im pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. Im sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here — here with me. So I… (LAUGHTER) Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. Ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, “Ive been out of work since May. Can you help me? ” Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, “Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part- time jobs. Hes lost his most recent job and weve now just lost our home. Can you help us? ” And the answer is, yes, we can help, but its going to take a different path. Not the one weve been on, not the one the president describes as a top- down, cut taxes for the rich. Thats not what Im going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. Were far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. Its small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30- year low.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key components of the speaker's plan to address unemployment and create jobs in America?
Mitt Romney,"Now, Im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more — if you will, trickle- down government — would work. Thats not the right answer for America. Ill restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the speaker's perspective on the current government's approach to economic management?
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle- down — his trick- down approach, as he said yours is.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weve got to improve our education system and weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. Weve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100, 000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years. But I also believe that weve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What specific actions should be taken to improve the education system and promote job training in the United States?
Barack Obama,"So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things Im sure well be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where theres a difference, because Governor Romneys central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut — on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts — thats another trillion dollars — and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for. Thats $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle- class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key challenges in achieving deficit reduction while ensuring sufficient revenue for investments?
Jim Lehrer,"Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that youd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, sure. Id like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I dont have a $5 trillion tax cut. I dont have a tax cut of a scale that youre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But Im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high- income people. High- income people are doing just fine in this economy. Theyll do fine whether youre president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the presidents policies, middle- income Americans have been buried. Theyre just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4, 300. This is a — this is a tax in and of itself. Ill call it the economy tax. Its been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2, 500 a family. Middle- income families are being crushed.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What challenges are middle-income Americans currently facing in the economy?
Mitt Romney,"And so the question is how to get them going again. And Ive described it. Its energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the — the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas Ill just note. First, education. I agree; Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. Weve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U. S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If Im president, Ill double them, and also get the — the oil from offshore and Alaska. And Ill bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. Im going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, Im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the — the revenues going to the government. My — my number- one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that; no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle- income Americans. And I — and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high- income Americans. So any — any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What key areas should be focused on to revitalize the economy and ensure fiscal responsibility?
Jim Lehrer,Mr. President?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, I think — lets talk about taxes, because I think its instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle- class families. And thats exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle- class families by about $3, 600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college, which means theyre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that hes been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnt been able to identify them. But Im going to make an important point here, Jim.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What impact do tax cuts for middle-class families have on the economy?
Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper- income individuals can — are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you dont come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How do current tax loopholes and deductions impact the funding of proposed tax cuts and military spending?
Barack Obama,"And thats why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romneys pledge of not reducing the deficit or — or — or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle- class families. The average middle- class family with children would pay about $2, 000 more. Now, thats not my analysis. Thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And — and that kind of top — top- down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250, 000 tax break, while middle- class families are burdened further, thats not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How would Governor Romney's economic policies impact middle-class families in terms of their financial burdens?
Jim Lehrer,All right. What is the difference? Lets just stay on taxes. (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Jim Lehrer,Just — lets just stay on taxes for (inaudible) . (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Jim Lehrer,What is the difference…,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, but — but virtually — virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What inaccuracies exist in the speaker's opponent's description of their tax plan?
Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, Id say absolutely not. Im not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What Ive said is I wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. Thats part one. So theres no economist that can say Mitt Romneys tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high- income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know its a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but its just not the case. Look, Ive got five boys. Im used to people saying something thats not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping Ill believe it. But that — that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high- income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle- income families. I will lower taxes on middle- income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by $3, 000 to $4, 000 on middle- income families. There are all these studies out there. But lets get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And youd think, well, then why lower the rates?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key principles that guide your tax plan and how do they differ from Mitt Romney's proposed tax plan?
Mitt Romney,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How will lowering the individual tax rate for small businesses impact job creation in America?
Jim Lehrer,Thats where we started. Yeah. Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, for 18 months hes been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, hes saying that his big, bold idea is, “Never mind. ” And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high- income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. Its — its math. Its arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small- business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250, 000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the implications of the proposed tax plan on middle-class families and the national deficit?
Barack Obama,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under — under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyre the job creators, theyd be burdened. But under Governor Romneys definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything, but — but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the differences in definitions of small business and their implications for economic growth?
Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Jim, let me just come back on that — on that point, which is these…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,"What point is Jim addressing, and what is the significance of that point?"
Jim Lehrer,Just for the — just for record… (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,… the small businesses were talking about…,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What role do small businesses play in the economy?
Jim Lehrer,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, were way over our first 15 minutes.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Its fun, isnt it?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What makes this enjoyable?
Jim Lehrer,"Its ok, its great. No problem. Well, you all dont have — you dont have a problem, I dont have a problem, because were still on the economy. Were going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. ok, but go ahead, sir.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"You bet. Well, President, youre — Mr. President, youre absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half — half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one- quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and — and Ive talked to a guy who has a very small business. Hes in the electronics business in — in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700, 000 jobs. I dont want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles- Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. Thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What impact will increasing the tax rate on small businesses have on employment and job creation?
Barack Obama,"Jim, I — you may want to move onto another topic, but I — I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion — just to give you a sense, over 10 years, thats more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well- to- do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romneys plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth. Look, weve tried this. Weve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the potential economic consequences of the tax and spending plan proposed by Governor Romney?
Barack Obama,"Bill Clinton tried the approach that Im talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle- class families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What evidence is there to support the effectiveness of tax breaks for middle-class families in stimulating job creation and economic growth?
Mitt Romney,"Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the significance of having the opportunity to make a concluding statement in this discussion?
Jim Lehrer,"Well, youre going to get the first word in the next segment.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the significance of having the first and last word in a discussion segment?
Mitt Romney,"I think first of all, let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what I said. Im not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. Thats not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. Thats point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thats not my plan. Number two, lets look at history. My plan is not like anything thats been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. Theyre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. Its absolutely extraordinary. Weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. Its just — its — weve got — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the speaker's plan for addressing tax policy and unemployment in the United States?
Jim Lehrer,"All right. Lets talk — were still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you — you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Good. Im glad you raised that, and its a — its a critical issue. I think its not just an economic issue, I think its a moral issue. I think its, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt were adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The presidents would — president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they dont pass it; Is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, Ill get rid of it. Obamacares on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the proposed solutions to address the issue of government spending and national debt?
Barack Obama,I like it.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is your opinion about it?
Mitt Romney,"Good. ok, good. So Ill get rid of that. Im sorry, Jim, Im going to stop the subsidy to PBS. Im going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But Im not going to — Im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. Thats number one. Number two, Ill take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What changes will be made to government spending and program management?
Mitt Romney,"Number three, Ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The president said hed cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion- dollar deficits for the last four years. The presidents put it in place as much public debt — almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What strategies can be implemented to make government more efficient and reduce the deficit?
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, two minutes.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion- dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from; two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what weve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a Great Depression, but what weve also said is, lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werent working very well, 18 government — 18 government programs for education that were well- intentioned, not werent helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. Thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that weve got to do more. And so Ive put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. Its on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2. 50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles- Simpson commission. Well, thats how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me just finish their point, because youre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.

Let me come back and say, why is it that I dont want to raise taxes? Why dont I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, “Look, Im going to extend the tax policies that we have now; Im not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when were in recession, you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone. ” Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just dont want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is its not just wealthy people — you mentioned Donald Trump. Its not just Donald Trump youre taxing. Its all those businesses that employ one- quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs.

Barack Obama,"If — if were serious, weve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Lets talk about corporate taxes. Now, Ive identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they dont get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when theyre making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldnt we want to eliminate that? Why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasnt identified which ones they are — but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but Ive actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesnt make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What changes can be made to corporate taxes to create a more balanced and responsible tax system that supports the economy?

Thats not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, were going to have to make some decisions. And if were asking for no revenue, then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, were talking about potentially a 30 — a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, thats a big problem. And governors are creative. Theres no doubt about it. But theyre not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.

And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors — Republican and Democrats — said, please let us do that.

So — so lets state — one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.

Jim Lehrer,"All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First — first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, weve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. Its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic Speaker Tip ONeill. But it is — the basic structure is sound. But — but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because thats the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother — some of you know — helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And thats the perspective I bring when I think about whats called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks whove worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,"What values should guide the discussion around Social Security and Medicare, considering their importance to individuals who have worked hard throughout their lives?"
Barack Obama,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long- term deficits, but to do that, lets look where some of the moneys going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a — make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the — throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What strategies can be implemented to strengthen Medicare and ensure its sustainability while also addressing long-term deficits?
Jim Lehrer,"Well follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if youre 60 or around 60 or older, you dont need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security hes not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, hes cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, “Were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybodys going to get a lower rate. ” Thats not just going after places where theres abuse. Thats saying were cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more Medicare patients. This — we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I cant understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, were putting some back. Were going to give a better prescription program. Thats $1 — thats $1 for every $15 youve cut. Theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion youve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.

Mitt Romney,"… people, right, not for current retirees.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,Who will be affected by the proposed changes to the retirement system?
Barack Obama,"For — so if youre — if youre 54 or 55, you might want to listen cause this — this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6, 000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is hell maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But theres still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, whatll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the potential consequences of implementing a voucher system for seniors in health care?
Barack Obama,"And then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I dont think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own — only my opinion. AARP thinks that the — the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, “Obamacare, ” if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. Theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier.

Mitt Romney,"So thats — thats number one. Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose — and theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they dont have to pay additional money, no additional $6, 000. Thats not going to happen. Theyll have at least two plans.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How will the proposed options for Medicare ensure that young individuals can access healthcare without incurring additional costs?
Mitt Romney,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is Id rather have a private plan. Id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. Id rather be able to have an insurance company. If I dont like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, were going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. Thats the plan that Ive put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, whos the co- author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill — Bill Clintons chief of staff. This is an idea thats been around a long time, which is saying, hey, lets see if we cant get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What approach is suggested to improve Medicare efficiency and provide better options for beneficiaries?
Barack Obama,"Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. Thats what they do. And so youve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romneys proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then theyre stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make.

Jim Lehrer,"All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there — should there be more? Beginning with you. This is not a new two- minute segment to start. And well go for a few minutes, and then were going to go to health care, ok?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Regulation is essential. You cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have — I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldnt have people opening up banks in their — in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,Why is regulation important for the functioning of a free market economy?

Mitt Romney,"No, it can become out of date. And whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term, youve seen regulation become excessive, and its hurt — its hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss thats been given to — to New York banks Ive ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. Thereve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank. So theres one example. Heres another. In Dodd- Frank…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the negative impacts of the Dodd-Frank legislation on the banking industry and the economy?

And there are some parts of Dodd- Frank that make all the sense in the world.

Mitt Romney,But lets — lets mention — let me mention the other one. Lets talk… (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What additional topic or issue is the speaker intending to address?
Jim Lehrer,"No, lets not. Lets let him respond — lets let him respond to this specific on Dodd- Frank and what the governor just said.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasnt just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were — that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given, because the folks didnt qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they werent. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said youve got — banks, youve got to raise your capital requirements. You cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. Weve going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so — so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What factors contributed to the economic crisis and what reforms have been implemented to prevent a similar situation in the future?
Barack Obama,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd- Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is; Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But thats not what I believe.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the significance of the Dodd-Frank Act in regulating Wall Street?
Mitt Romney,"Sorry, but thats just not — thats just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. Thats why Id have regulation. But I wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. Thats one of the unintended consequences of Dodd- Frank. It wasnt thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks. Theyre getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd- Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified. Thats exactly right. Its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd- Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didnt ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. Its been two years. We dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. Its hurt the housing market because Dodd- Frank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. Its not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation. I will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the shortcomings of the Dodd-Frank regulations and how do they impact banks and the housing market?
Jim Lehrer,"All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, lets move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And its a two- minute new — new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Jim Lehrer,You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I cant afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, were thinking of dropping our insurance, we cant afford it. And the number of small businesses Ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And — and weve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2, 500 a year more than traditional insurance. So its adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2, 500 a family. Instead, its gone up by that amount. So its expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So thats one reason I dont want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I dont like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, whats been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three- quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just dont know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the — at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state; craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then lets focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2, 500 additional premium.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the main reasons for opposing the Affordable Care Act as mentioned in the statement?
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, the argument against repeal?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre- existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, theyre paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they dont have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle- class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if youve got health insurance, it doesnt mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around. They cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance plan until youre 26 years old. And it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you dont have health insurance, were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point Id make before…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What key changes did Obamacare implement to address the challenges faced by families and small businesses regarding health insurance?
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes — two minutes is up, sir.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"No, I think — I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was … (LAUGHTER) … the irony is that weve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasnt destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What evidence supports the effectiveness of the healthcare model implemented in Massachusetts?
Jim Lehrer,"Your five seconds went away a long time ago. All right, Governor. Governor, tell — tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, I did with my first statement. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What was the content or significance of your first statement?
Mitt Romney,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary — elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didnt raise taxes. Youve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didnt cut Medicare. Of course, we dont have Medicare, but we didnt cut Medicare by $716 billion.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key differences between the healthcare approach taken in Massachusetts and the approach taken at the federal level?
Mitt Romney,"We didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive. We didnt also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put — put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people dont want Medicare — dont want Obamacare. Its why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had — had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the main concerns regarding the implementation of Obamacare and its impact on insurance coverage?
Barack Obama,"Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say its the same plan. It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that weve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and thats been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They — they say, if a patients coming in, lets get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes. Lets — lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve — theyve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, lets use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — its true — but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So were already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, youre already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, Im just going to repeal it, but — but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with, other than saying were going to leave it to the states.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,"What are the benefits of the health care plan proposed in Massachusetts, and how does it aim to reduce costs while improving care?"
Barack Obama,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a pre- existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, its estimated that by repealing Obamacare, youre looking at 50 million people losing health insurance…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the potential consequences of repealing Obamacare on individuals with pre-existing conditions?

Mitt Romney,Well…,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,It seems you haven't provided a full statement or context for me to identify the implicit question. Could you please share a more complete statement that I could analyze?
Jim Lehrer,… if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, actually its — its — its a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. Thats already offered in the private marketplace. You dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But lets come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,"What are the key features of the health care plan being discussed, particularly regarding coverage and affordability?"
Mitt Romney,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and thats happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How can the private market and competition among health care providers effectively reduce health care costs?
Mitt Romney,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. Thats the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What approach should be taken to healthcare to ensure better outcomes for patients and providers?
Barack Obama,"Let me just point out first of all this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given. Thats explicitly prohibited in the law. But lets go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isnt what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve — if its been under 90 days. But thats already the law and that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. Theres a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasnt a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that “insurers, youve got to take everybody. ” Now, that also means that youve got more customers. But when — when Governor Romney says that hell replace it with something, but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the limitations of Governor Romney's plan regarding coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions?
Barack Obama,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. Thats how its going to be paid for, but we dont know the details. He says that hes going to replace Dodd- Frank, Wall Street reform, but we dont know exactly which ones. He wont tell us. He now says hes going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because theyre too good? Is it — is it because that somehow middle- class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre- existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and weve got to make choices. And the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle- class families all across the country.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What concerns arise from the lack of details in Governor Romney's proposed plans?

Jim Lehrer,"No, but…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say, “Its my way or the highway, ” I dont get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip ONeill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. Youve said the same thing, youre going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle- income families. And Im going to work together with Congress to say, ok, what — what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25, 000, $50, 000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high- income people. Thats one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles- Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre- existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on — on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre- existing conditions. Thats part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What approach should be taken to effectively collaborate with Congress to simplify the tax code and improve healthcare access?

And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you — but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President — do you believe theres a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,

Jim Lehrer,And do you — yeah.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. Thats its most basic function. And as commander- in- chief, that is something that Ive worked on and thought about every single day that Ive been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the primary role of the federal government according to the speaker?
Barack Obama,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, lets help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, lets start the National Academy of Sciences, lets start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, were all going to be better off. That doesnt restrict peoples freedom. That enhances it. And so what Ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what Ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasnt a top- down approach, Governor. What weve said is to states, well give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what Ive also said is lets hire another 100, 000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard- pressed states right now cant all do that. In fact weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesnt think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It cant do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence well have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the rationale behind government investment in education and teacher hiring to enhance opportunities for all Americans?
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I dont believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government; Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the role of government in relation to education and the promotion of great teachers?
Mitt Romney,"First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of Americas military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by — by one another. Were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we — we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what were seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle- down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And its not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year cant find work.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What principles should guide the United States in ensuring the protection of its citizens' rights and well-being?

Mitt Romney,We know that the path were taking is not working. Its time for a new path.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the need for a change in the current approach?
Jim Lehrer,All right. Lets go through some specifics in terms of what — how each of you views the role of government. How do — education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is — is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I — and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, hes — some ideas hes put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and — and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and — and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is Ive added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I — these are disabled kids or — or — or poor kids or — or lower- income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the — to the state or to the school district, Id have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their — their — their student.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What role should the federal government play in improving education at the state and local levels?

Barack Obama,"Well, as Ive indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, weve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and theyre having an impact right now.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What role does the Race to the Top program play in educational reform?
Jim Lehrer,Do you think you have a difference with your views and — and those of Governor Romney on — about education and the federal government?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his — his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romneys talked about. And it wasnt very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But — but what it did do is to — if you extrapolated how much money were talking about, youd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What impact would the proposed tax cuts have on federal support for education?
Barack Obama,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,How can community colleges collaborate with businesses to effectively train individuals for existing job opportunities?
Jim Lehrer,"Do you — do you agree, Governor?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,Let me just finish the point. (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What point is the speaker trying to clarify or emphasize?
Barack Obama,"The — where theyre partnering so that theyre designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether its two- year or four- year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, “Why not cut out the middleman? ” And as a consequence, what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, “you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, ” you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just dont have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. Its how were going to grow this economy over the long term.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What strategies can be implemented to make college more affordable and accessible for students?

Jim Lehrer,Governor?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Mr. President, Mr. President, youre entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, Im not going to cut education funding. I dont have any plan to cut education funding and — and grants that go to people going to college. Im planning on (inaudible) to grow. So Im not planning on making changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into — into green jobs. And I — look, Im all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have — that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for Americas government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Lets grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a — to a school that hes being more successful. I dont want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, Ive had that experience. I dont just talk about it. Ive been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didnt have commitment to education. Its because I care about education for all of our kids.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the speaker's stance on education funding and how does it relate to the government's role in the economy?

Barack Obama,Youve done a great job.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What feedback do you have about the work that has been done?
Jim Lehrer,"Oh, well, no. But the fact is government — the role of government and governing, weve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three — three minutes left in the — in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, weve got three minutes total time here — and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re- elected, in your case, what would you do about that? Governor?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Jim, I had the great experience — it didnt seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What strategies did the speaker use to achieve success in a predominantly Democrat state legislature?
Jim Lehrer,But what would you do as president?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"We — as president, I will sit on day one — actually, the day after I get elected — Ill sit down with leaders — the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue — as we did in my state — we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the — in the — in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because were going to compromise our principle, but because theres common ground. And the challenges America faces right now — look, the reason Im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face — this deficit could crush the future generations. Whats happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What approach will the speaker take to address the challenges facing America after being elected president?
Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership — leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if — if its a Republican or a Democrat. Ive done it before. Ill do it again.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the significance of leadership in Washington for achieving collaboration between Republicans and Democrats?
Jim Lehrer,Mr. President?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romneys going to have a busy first day, because hes also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as youre sitting down with them. (LAUGHTER) But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middle- class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. Thats how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. Thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause. Thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. Thats how we repealed “dont ask/dont tell. ” Thats how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and thats how were going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Thats how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. So weve — weve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, “Ill sit down, ” but you have to have a plan. Number two, whats important is occasionally youve got to say no, to — to — to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when — when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When — when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What is the speaker's philosophy regarding collaboration with both political parties to strengthen middle-class families?
Jim Lehrer,All right,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And Ive got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What qualities of leadership are necessary for effective governance?
Jim Lehrer,"That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Barack Obama,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver. You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that theyre helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that Ive tried to do, and everything that Im now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is — is channeled and — and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybodys getting a fair shot. And everybodys getting a fair share — everybodys doing a fair share, and everybodys playing by the same rules. You know, four years ago, I said that Im not a perfect man and I wouldnt be a perfect president. And thats probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks Ive kept. But I also promised that Id fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. Ive kept that promise and if youll vote for me, then I promise Ill fight just as hard in a second term.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key goals and proposals for improving the future of America in the next four years?
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Romney, your two- minute closing.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
Mitt Romney,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is a — this is an important election and Im concerned about America. Im concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I — I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. Its bigger than our respective parties. Its an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month were going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. Were talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And its not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. Theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected youll continue to see a middle- class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. Ill get incomes up again. Youll see chronic unemployment. Weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If Im president I will create — help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the presidents reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. Youre going to see health premiums go up by some $2, 500 per family. If Im elected we wont have Obama. Well put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and well focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected youre going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. Youll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. Youll have hospital and providers thatll no longer accept Medicare patients. Ill restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The presidents reelected youll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get Americas middle class working again. Thank you, Jim.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0,What are the key differences in policies proposed by the candidates that will impact America's future direction and quality of life?
Jim Lehrer,"Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mr. President. The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, Im Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night. Â ",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0,
