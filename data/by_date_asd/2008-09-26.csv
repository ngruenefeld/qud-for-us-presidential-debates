Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And youre wondering, hows it going to affect me? Hows it going to affect my job? Hows it going to affect my house? Hows it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market — and when the market returns. Number three, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What proposals need to be implemented to address the current economic crisis and protect taxpayers?,"Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, “We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, ” end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.",0.83312225,0.9048025,0.74762726,0.36599076
John McCain,"Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I — Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why. Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in — certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while. But the point is — the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to — it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What progress is being made in the bipartisan effort to address the current fiscal crisis?,"Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, “We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, ” end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question.

Barack Obama,"We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So — so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that. But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st- century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,"What are the primary factors that led to the current economic situation, and how should we address both the immediate problem and the underlying regulatory issues?","All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you — do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you — are you in favor of this plan?",0.84181684,0.9238473,0.7246255,0.18391326
John McCain,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out- of- control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork- barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork- barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D. C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What is the plan to control government spending and address the issues of earmarking and pork-barrel spending?,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word “fundamental, ” are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?",0.8829878,0.9218998,0.770512,0.29689816
Barack Obama,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me. But lets be clear; Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700, 000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to — wants to follow.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What is the difference between the speaker's tax policy approach and Senator McCain's proposed tax cuts?,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word “fundamental, ” are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?",0.8796658,0.93339217,0.81656027,0.4441879
Barack Obama,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel- efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just — a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some — some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What priorities should the government focus on to address economic challenges and improve competitiveness?,"All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue — the financial rescue thing that we started — started asking about. And what — and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is its going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?",0.8344878,0.91351813,0.70551133,0.34303623
John McCain,"Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have — as I said, weve let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point — the point is — the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return — particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations — we have to do away with cost- plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it. So we need to have fixed- cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What actions should be taken to cut government spending and manage defense costs effectively?,"Are you — what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the — because of the financial bailout cost?",0.8622904,0.90957934,0.73161113,0.42629647
John McCain,"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,"What would be the implications of implementing a spending freeze while exempting defense, veteran affairs, and entitlement programs?","What Im trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all — one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the — in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what Im trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific — small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.",0.7539132,0.9090713,0.63834065,0.25029927
John McCain,"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What lessons should be learned from the military strategy and execution in Iraq?,"All right. Lets go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?",0.8922098,0.9124333,0.7190018,0.5489241
Barack Obama,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4, 000 lives. We have seen 30, 000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What are the key reasons for opposing the war in Iraq and how does this reflect on the use of military force in foreign policy?,"All right. Lets go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?",0.8640972,0.92613643,0.76190954,0.3652889
Barack Obama,"Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U. S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place — Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai. Number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What steps should be taken to effectively address the challenges in Afghanistan and combat the threats posed by Al Qaida and the Taliban?,"Afghanistan, lead — a new — a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan. (LAUGHTER) And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and its a — it picks up on a point thats already been made. Do you think more troops — more U. S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?",0.8024256,0.924585,0.7413506,0.44157764
John McCain,"First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger. Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. Weve got to get the support of the people of — of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic) , has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20, 000 additional troops, from 32, 000 to 53, 000, and there needs to be more. So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What approach should the United States take in assisting Pakistan while addressing the challenges posed by the Taliban and Al Qaida?,"Afghanistan, lead — a new — a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan. (LAUGHTER) And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and its a — it picks up on a point thats already been made. Do you think more troops — more U. S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?",0.7897203,0.9206972,0.72996545,0.39715105
John McCain,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people – a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What actions should be taken to address the nuclear threat posed by Iran and its implications for regional and global security?,"New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?",0.8477031,0.92420423,0.77096224,0.5712826
Barack Obama,"Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six- party — or the six- point cease- fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st- century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th- century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15, 000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40, 000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What should be the United States' approach to dealing with a resurgent and aggressive Russia?,"New lead question. Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama. How do you see the relationship with Russia? Do you see them as a competitor? Do you see them as an enemy? Do you see them as a potential partner?",0.86643094,0.92427266,0.82596505,0.4921269
John McCain,"Well, I was interested in Senator Obamas reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, “Both sides ought to show restraint. ” Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro- dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik- run government. I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a “K, ” a “G, ” and a “B. ” And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What is the importance of recognizing Russia's aggression towards Georgia in relation to U.S. foreign policy and support for allies?,"New lead question.

Do you see them as a potential partner?",0.84473133,0.9276823,0.7870681,0.51582146
John McCain,"I think its much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,"What progress has been made in improving national security and intelligence since 9/11, and what further measures are needed to ensure America's safety?","This is the last — last lead question.

Barack Obama,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the — the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",Pres,2008,2008-09-26,1,What are the key priorities for improving national security and addressing the threat of terrorism?,"This is the last — last lead question.
