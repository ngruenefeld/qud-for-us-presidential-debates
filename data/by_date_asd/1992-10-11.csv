Ross Perot,"I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot. I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What makes your candidacy different from those of the established political parties?,"The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other.

George H. W. Bush,"I think the American people should be the judge of that. I think character is a very important question. I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned — I put it this way; I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. I — well, maybe they say, “Well, it was a youthful indiscretion. ” I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating — its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. They get on me — Bills gotten on me about, “read my lips. ” When I make a mistake Ill admit it. But he has made — not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land — organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted. Some say, “well, youre a little old fashioned. ” Maybe I am, but I just dont think thats right. Now, whether its character or judgment — whatever it is — I have a big difference here on this issue and so well just have to see how it plays out. But I — I couldnt do that. And I dont think most Americans could do that. And they all say, “Well, it was a long time ago. ” Well, lets admit it then. Say, “I made a terrible mistake. ” How could you be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say — when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, “Well, Im not going to go. The Commander- in- Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era. So there are differences but thats about the main area where I think we have a difference. I dont know about — well talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What are the implications of character and judgment in determining someone's fitness to be Commander-in-Chief?,"President Bush, the question goes to you. you have two minutes.

Bill Clinton,"The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200, 000 and above. Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down. Middle- class people, defined as people with incomes of $52, 000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan- Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes. So that is where my income limit would trigger.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,"Who would be affected by the proposed tax increase, and how does it relate to income trends from the 1980s?","Governor Clinton, can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle- income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or, at the very least, at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase?",0.793864,0.9324963,0.7952205,0.54221344
George H. W. Bush,"Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is; for 40- some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What justifications are there for maintaining the current level of U.S. defense spending and military presence in Europe?,"Mr. President, this past week your secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut US forces in Europe from 150 to 100 thousand by the end of September 1996. Now, why, almost 50 years after the end of World War II, and with the total collapse of the Soviet Union, should American taxpayers be taxed to support armies in Europe when the Europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves?",0.8440136,0.92953116,0.8325428,0.4823263
Ross Perot,"Its 10 cents a year cumulative. It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year. I think “punish” is the wrong word. Again, see, I didnt create this problem. Were trying to solve it. Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3. 50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we dont have it to spend. I know its not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we dont, we will be spending our childrens money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think its fitting that were on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. Weve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. Weve got to collect the taxes to do it. If theres a fairer way, Im all ears (laughter) – aah. (Laughter and applause) But– but– see, let me make it very clear. If people dont have the stomach to fix these problems, I think its a good time to face it, November. If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. Im not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What is the rationale for implementing a tax increase to address the economic challenges facing the nation?,"Mr Perot, you talked about fairness just a minute ago and sharing the pain. As part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit, youve suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years. Why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree?",0.849986,0.9268914,0.8181418,0.41862965
George H. W. Bush,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes. I think its a good decision– took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And we worked it out, and indeed were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50, 000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, youre going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that were proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is; stimulate investment and savings. I mean, weve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; were ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs Ive talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer– a little longer run; its going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her its not all that gloomy; were the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. Im much more optimistic about this country than some. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What are the best strategies for job retraining and economic recovery in the context of defense spending cuts?,"Mr. President, last month you came to St. Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F- 15s for Saudi Arabia. In todays Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75- year- old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates. She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense- oriented industries into other purposes. How would you answer her.",0.8135581,0.9151453,0.7134781,0.21739665
Ross Perot,"Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, Ill get with congressional– we wont even wait till inauguration, and Ill ask the president to help me and Ill ask his staff to help me. And we will start putting together teams to put together– to take all the plans that exist and do something with them. Please understand. There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes. Its like having a blueprint for a house you never built. You dont have anywhere to sleep. Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them. Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that. The second, youve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries– have another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they dont wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schools– one on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage whove been in meetings when I would sit there and say, “Is this the one were going to talk about or do something about? ” Well, obviously, my orientation is lets go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things. Small business– youve got to have capital, youve got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches. And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What steps will you take to ensure effective execution of existing plans to boost the economy and create jobs following the election?,"Mr. Perot, you talked a minute ago about rebuilding the job base. But is it true what Governor Clinton just said, that that means that unemployment will increase, that it will slow the economy? And how would you specifically use the powers of the presidency to get more people back into good jobs immediately?",0.8936215,0.930362,0.81812334,0.5659549
Bill Clinton,"Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works. But frankly, I dont think thats the problem today. We have low interest rates today. At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control. Our long- term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance. And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle- down economics– another across- the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment. But I think the important thing– the important thing– is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, were going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. That is my commitment. I think the American people are ready for action. I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them. Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done. Give me a chance to do that. I dont have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve. Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What strategies should the president implement to keep interest rates down while encouraging investment and reducing the national debt?,"Governor Clinton, when a president running for the first time gets into the office and wants to do something about the economy, he finds in Washington theres a person who has much more power over the economy than he does; the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, accountable to no one. That being the case, would you go along with proposals made by Treasury Secretary James Brady and Congressman Lee Hamilton to make the Federal Reserve Board chairman somehow more accountable to elected officials?",0.8012524,0.9328728,0.777055,0.35998723
Ross Perot,"Again, if youre not rich, youre not a superpower. So we have two that Id put as number one. I have number 1 and 1A. One is weve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and weve got to manufacture here. Believe it or not folks, you cant ship it all overseas, youve got to make it here. And you cant convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. Weve got to make things here. You cant ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. Weve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember were thinking of many countries, now. Weve got to help them. Thats pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, weve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. Its a very unstable situation. Youve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And weve focused on the tactical. Weve made real progress there. Weve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we dont have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, weve got to be financially strong. Number two, weve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil. Because they could go back worse than things used to be. And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K. G. B. and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What are the key priorities for ensuring national security and supporting democracy in post-Soviet Russia?,"Mr Perot, in the postwar coldwar environment, what should be the overriding U. S. national interest? And what can the United States do, and what can it afford to do, to defend the national interest?",0.88216484,0.92346585,0.80598235,0.32567
Bill Clinton,"I think our relationships with China are important and I dont want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square. Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it. They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology. That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society. Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty. If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China. And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What should the United States' approach be towards China to balance trade interests and human rights concerns?,"Governor Clinton, you accused the President of coddling tyrants, including those in Beijing.

George H. W. Bush,"Ann, both of them are very complicated situations. And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam. I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out. We are helping. American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo. It is America thats in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia. But when you go to put somebody elses son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that theres a military plan that can do this. You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavias dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isnt going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and Im not going to do that as commander- in- chief. I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and were making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there. And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no- fly operation up there in– no- fly order up in the United Nations. Were working through the international organizations. Thats one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly– highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator. Use– work internationally to do it. I am very concerned about it. I am concerned about ethnic cleansing. I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there. But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it. And I think Im on the right track.",Pres,1992,1992-10-11,1,What criteria should guide the decision to commit US forces to international conflicts?,"Mr. President, how can you watch the killing in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing, or the starvation and anarchy in Somalia, and not want to use Americas might, if not Americas military, to try to end that kind of suffering?",0.85291827,0.913698,0.72954714,0.3468134
