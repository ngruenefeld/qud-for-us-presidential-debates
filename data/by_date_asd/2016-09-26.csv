Hillary Clinton,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together. Today is my granddaughters second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for womens work. I also want to see more companies do profit- sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. Ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under. So lets have paid family leave, earned sick days. Lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt- free college. How are we going to do it? Were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, its good to be with you. Were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What plans do you propose to build a fair and inclusive economy that benefits all citizens?,"Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. Theres been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers?",0.8840765,0.91964173,0.76030254,0.32247192
Donald Trump,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left— fired 1, 400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What strategies can be implemented to prevent jobs and companies from leaving the United States?,"Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs.

Donald Trump,"Well, for one thing— and before we start on that— my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company thats worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our countrys in deep trouble. We dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. Theyre the best, the best ever at it. What theyre doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, theyre taking our jobs, theyre giving incentives, theyre doing things that, frankly, we dont do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. Were on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell in— automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement. Its been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians havent done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton— yes, is that ok? Good. I want you to be very happy. Its very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. Shes been doing this for 30 years. And why hasnt she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact…",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,"What is the issue with current trade deals, particularly regarding the impact of foreign taxation and agreements on American jobs?","Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. Youve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.

How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",0.7771914,0.9171301,0.7817309,0.4195612
Donald Trump,"Well, the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. Theyre leaving, and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, youre wrong. And once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what Im saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And thats a big, big factor.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,How can the United States incentivize companies to stay domestic and prevent job outsourcing?,"How do you bring back— specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?",0.89878935,0.9256079,0.77849025,0.5420432
Donald Trump,"Well, Im really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. Theyre going to expand their companies. Theyre going to do a tremendous job. Im getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, its not a tax— its really not a great thing for the wealthy. Its a great thing for the middle class. Its a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when theyre going to bring $2. 5 trillion back from overseas, where they cant bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton wont allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what— is so bad. So what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal to— and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together. Because we have— we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And heres the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2. 5 trillion. I happen to think its double that. Its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, youd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership.

Donald Trump,"I dont mind releasing— Im under a routine audit. And itll be released. And— as soon as the audits finished, it will be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104- page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income— in fact, the income— I just looked today— the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. But thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country thats doing so badly, thats being ripped off by every single country in the world, its the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody— Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.

You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit. So youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesnt want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,"Why is it important for presidential candidates to release their tax returns, and what concerns arise when they do not?","You were talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.

Hillary Clinton,"Well, youre right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system. Weve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And weve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. Ive laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that were seeing today.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,What actions should be taken to address racial challenges and reform the criminal justice system in the United States?,"We move into our next segment talking about Americas direction.

Donald Trump,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words, and thats law and order. And we need law and order. If we dont have it, were not going to have a country. And when I look at whats going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country, whether its— I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long— we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just— just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very— I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, theyve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And Im saying, where is this? Is this a war- torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4, 000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over— almost 4, 000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, theyre illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.

Hillary Clinton,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. Ive met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit its an issue. Theyve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.

And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.

Hillary Clinton,"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly were facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. Theres no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donalds very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really… [crosstalk] … tough, long game here. And one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear— whether its Russia, China, Iran or anybody else— the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private- sector information or our public- sector information. And were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think theyve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And thats why I was so— I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.

That just happened, and many more are coming. And Im very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed— 16, 500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, Ill take the admirals and Ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. ok? Because look at the mess that were in. Look at the mess that were in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps were not. I dont think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. Shes saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I dont— maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok? You dont know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. Thats what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under President Obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyre beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is— it is a huge problem. I have a son. Hes 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, its unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe its hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.

And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10, 000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them. Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil— and we should have taken the oil— ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.

Donald Trump,"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their— they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B- 52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not— we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1. 7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they dont have to do much.",Pres,2016,2016-09-26,1,"What are the implications of the current U.S. nuclear strategy and international agreements, particularly regarding Russia, Iran, and North Korea?","Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing America.

Hillary Clinton,"Well, let me— let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that Americas word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. Ive talked with a number of them. But I want to— on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. Its also important that we look at the entire global situation.
