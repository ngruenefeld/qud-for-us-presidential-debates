Al Gore,"Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say Im happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bushs experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If Im entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle- class families. I believe its important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If Im entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still wont be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle- class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that its not just a question of experience.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What choices will you make to ensure that America's prosperity benefits all families rather than just a few?,"And now the first question as determined by a flip of a coin, it goes to Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be President of the United States. What exactly do you mean?",0.8707122,0.9256955,0.76155555,0.09633266
Al Gore,"Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether its the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bushs tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, Ill put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think its very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think its very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and weve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But its now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What are the priorities and implications of the proposed tax cut plans and spending initiatives for the country?,"So I take it by your answer, then, Mr. Vice President, that in an interview recently with the “New York Times” when you said that you questioned whether or not Governor Bush has experience enough to be president, you were talking about strictly policy differences.",0.8414293,0.9035502,0.65642107,0.143757
George W. Bush,"Yes. I take him for his word. Look, I fully recognize Im not of Washington. Im from Texas. And hes got a lot of experience, but so do I. And Ive been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs. Somebody that can come to Washington and say lets forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What qualifications and experiences do you have that make you capable of working collaboratively in Washington to address key issues?,"Let me just follow up one quick question. When you hear Vice President Gore question your experience, do you read it the same way, that hes talking about policy differences only?",0.7990254,0.9150989,0.70251715,0.14525127
George W. Bush,"Actually what Ive said, Jim. Ive said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they cant get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but its time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what Ive said is that theres been some missed opportunities. Theyve had a chance. Theyve had a chance to form consensus. Ive got a plan on Medicare, for example, thats a two- stage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if youre happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, its time to get it done once and for all. Thats what Ive been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear Ill trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What has been the failure of previous administrations in addressing the needs of seniors regarding Medicare and Social Security?,"Governor Bush, you have a question. This is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore. You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States. What do you mean by that?",0.817413,0.91389745,0.72687185,0.13166659
Al Gore,"Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short- term component, but also a long- term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short- term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long- term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What are the key differences between your energy plan and Governor Bush's approach to energy production in terms of short-term and long-term strategies?,Vice President Gore. How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?,0.9133274,0.94495195,0.86593574,0.5662416
Al Gore,"Let me clarify. Im for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side. Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bushs answer that we certainly agree on, and thats the low income heating assistance program. I commend you for supporting that. I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that Ive worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, weve faced a lot of opposition to them. Theyve only approved about 10% of the agenda Ive helped to send up there. I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What specific actions will you take to address the energy crisis and promote renewable energy and conservation?,"So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. Youre for doing something on the consumption end and youre for doing something on the production end?",0.7021649,0.9189182,0.6854777,0.2651537
George W. Bush,"Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesnt believe in exploration in Alaska. Theres a lot of shut- in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. Theres an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? Im against removing dams in the northwest. I donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. Im going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short- term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, hes a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. Its time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What actions should the United States take to address its energy dependency and explore domestic resources effectively?,"So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. Youre for doing something on the consumption end and youre for doing something on the production end?",0.6750587,0.90861315,0.6494359,0.27572012
George W. Bush,"I dont think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and Im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. Weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What steps can be taken to promote a culture of life and reduce the number of abortions in America?,"New question, new subject. Governor Bush. If elected president, would you try to overturn the FDAs approval last week of the abortion pill RU- 486?",0.82331336,0.91783065,0.7299824,0.32928258
George W. Bush,I dont think a president can unilaterally overturn it. The FDA has made its decision.,Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,Can a president unilaterally overturn a decision made by the FDA?,"Governor, well go to the Supreme Court question in a moment, but make sure I understand your position on RU- 486.

George W. Bush,"The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue. Voters will know Ill put competent judges on the bench. People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy. That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me. I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government. That theyre appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred. They shouldnt misuse their bench. I dont believe in liberal activist judges. I believe in strict constructionists. Those are the kind of judges I will appoint. Ive named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations. Theyre good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,"What criteria will you use to select judges if elected, and how does it differ from your opponent's approach?","Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court, federal court, will also be pro- life?",0.87496877,0.92007905,0.74072015,0.37827343
Al Gore,"We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome. I dont favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution. And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history. And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Its very clear to me. I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,"What criteria should be used to evaluate judicial nominees' interpretations of the Constitution, especially concerning landmark decisions like Roe v. Wade?",What kind of appointments should they expect from you?,0.7785462,0.8819232,0.5980047,0.28741348
Al Gore,"Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. Its overwhelming. Milosevics government refuses to release the vote count. Theres now a general strike going on. Theyre demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so- called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, weve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that weve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism — even if they dont like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that hell be out of office very shortly.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What actions should the United States take to support the democratic transition in Serbia following the election results?,"New subject, new question. Vice President Gore, if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office, what action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there?",0.898474,0.93620074,0.8539901,0.5947576
Al Gore,"In this particular situation, no. Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, Im not sure its right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this — this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think thats the wrong thing. I think the governors instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,Should the United States involve Russia in mediating the political situation in Serbia?,"What if he doesnt leave? What if all the diplomatic efforts, all the pressure from all over the world and he still doesnt go? Is this the kind of thing, to be specific, that you as president would consider the use of U. S. military force to get him gone?",0.78952324,0.9008218,0.73012197,0.24560732
George W. Bush,"Well, if its in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are — our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well- equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I dont think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think weve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in todays military is too low. Were having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well- equipped. I believe were overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. Its to make sure our troops are well- housed and well- equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high- skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What criteria should guide the decision to use military force in international conflicts?,"New question.

Al Gore,"Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds. When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army. I served my country in Vietnam. My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did. But I went anyway because I knew if I didnt, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place. I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years Ive served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, thats where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology. The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons. I think thats a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What experiences and insights support the importance of making sound military and defense judgments?,"Vice President Gore, how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions, whether its Milosevic or whatever, in the military and foreign policy area?",0.84016836,0.9101076,0.7518374,0.2938578
George W. Bush,"I think youve got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office. Whether or not its — the same in domestic policy as well. Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow? Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. Ive been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that Ive had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think thats an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. Ive shown I know how to do so. Tonight in the audience theres one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state- wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to — because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead. And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and whos shown the ability to get things done?",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What qualities and experiences demonstrate a candidate's ability to lead effectively in office?,"Governor, how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue?",0.859792,0.8996651,0.6844677,0.27522302
Al Gore,"Oh, absolutely. This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, weve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesnt go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bushs plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think weve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I dont think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. Ill veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. Ill give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What priorities should guide the use of the current budget surplus to benefit all Americans?,"New subject. New question.

George W. Bush,"We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. Its about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying Im going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so- called at- risk children. Its how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they cant learn. Its a school of strong discipline and high standards. Its one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, dont put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. Thats what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. Thats my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers dont know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just wont teach and wont change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K- 2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach- for- the- children type teachers. Four, were going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to — the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What reforms are necessary to ensure federal education funding is contingent on measurable results in public schools?,"Having cleared that up, were going to a new question. Education. Governor Bush. Both of you have promised dramatically to change — to change dramatically public education in this country. Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money. You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money, is that possible?",0.72203356,0.91305137,0.6627309,0.50295484
George W. Bush,"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gores plan. He says hes for voluntary testing. You cant have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. Thats the difference. You may claim youve got mandatory testing but you dont, Mr. Vice President. Thats a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because its the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? Weve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. Were going to ask you to show us whether or not — we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that wont teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts.

Al Gore,"When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat. But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on. I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia. But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle- class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the — the policies and the laws to their advantage. You can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bushs prescription drug proposal. They oppose mine because they dont want to get Medicare involved because theyre afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What has been the speaker's approach to balancing the interests of middle-class families against powerful corporate interests throughout their public service?,"New question. Weve been talking about a lot of specific issues. Its often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected, not with issues that came up in the campaign. Vice President Gore, can you point to a decision, an action you have taken, that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected, the crisis under fire?",0.8238726,0.9311129,0.80740523,0.21058255
George W. Bush,"Well, it depends, obviously. But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. Thats what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that were confronted with. In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What steps would you take to address a financial crisis as a governor?,"New question. There can be all kinds of crises, Governor. A questions for you. There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution.

George W. Bush,"No, theres no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and thats the role of goverment to encourage that. In terms of in response to the question, no.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What is the speaker's perspective on the impact of government versus the role of entrepreneurship on economic growth?,"So, Governor, would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening — on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis?",0.8617201,0.9225817,0.772621,0.3063712
Al Gore,"I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that its very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I dont go along with it. I am opposed to it. Im also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I dont think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and Ill tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.",Pres,2000,2000-10-03,1,What is your stance on preserving Social Security and preventing cuts to its benefits?,"Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes.

George W. Bush,"The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot. And I love mine. The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family. I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, “No controlling legal authority. ” I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe that — I believe theyve moved that sign, “The buck stops here” from the Oval Office desk to “The buck stops here” on the Lincoln bedroom. Its not good for the country and its not right. We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. Theres a huge trust. I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I dont want you to let me down again. And we can do better than the past administration has done. Its time for a fresh start. Its time for a new look. Its time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism. And so I dont know the man well, but Ive been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.

George W. Bush,"I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check- off. Ive campaigned on this since the primaries.
