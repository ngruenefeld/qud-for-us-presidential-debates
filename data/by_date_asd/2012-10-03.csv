Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (LAUGHTER) You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weve been, but where were going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that well be better off. Ive got a different view. I think weve got to invest in education and training. I think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters — to you — which path we should take. Are we going to double on top- down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And Im looking forward to having that debate.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What approach should the United States take to ensure economic growth and recovery in the future?,What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?,0.8293407,0.8989805,0.6792673,0.20034781
Mitt Romney,"Thank you, Jim. Its an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. Im pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. Im sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here — here with me. So I… (LAUGHTER) Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. Ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, “Ive been out of work since May. Can you help me? ” Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, “Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part- time jobs. Hes lost his most recent job and weve now just lost our home. Can you help us? ” And the answer is, yes, we can help, but its going to take a different path. Not the one weve been on, not the one the president describes as a top- down, cut taxes for the rich. Thats not what Im going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. Were far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. Its small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30- year low.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What is your plan to help address the current economic challenges facing American families and businesses?,What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?,0.92483556,0.9228289,0.7697545,0.30234182
Mitt Romney,"Good. Im glad you raised that, and its a — its a critical issue. I think its not just an economic issue, I think its a moral issue. I think its, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt were adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The presidents would — president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they dont pass it; Is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, Ill get rid of it. Obamacares on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What strategies should be implemented to address the deficit while considering both economic growth and moral implications for future generations?,"And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",0.81598926,0.9248076,0.7837701,0.61699677
Barack Obama,"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion- dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from; two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what weve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a Great Depression, but what weve also said is, lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werent working very well, 18 government — 18 government programs for education that were well- intentioned, not werent helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. Thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that weve got to do more. And so Ive put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. Its on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2. 50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles- Simpson commission. Well, thats how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me just finish their point, because youre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney… (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What is the plan to reduce the deficit while balancing cuts and revenue increases?,"And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",0.83066493,0.9150375,0.76754427,0.5927906
Barack Obama,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, weve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. Its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic Speaker Tip ONeill. But it is — the basic structure is sound. But — but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because thats the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother — some of you know — helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And thats the perspective I bring when I think about whats called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks whove worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What is the importance of Social Security and Medicare to individuals who have worked throughout their lives?,Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?,0.85094774,0.920949,0.7365872,0.5780966
Barack Obama,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long- term deficits, but to do that, lets look where some of the moneys going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a — make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the — throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,How can the United States strengthen Medicare and Social Security while addressing long-term deficits?,Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?,0.7552756,0.8916539,0.6298208,0.4145658
Mitt Romney,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if youre 60 or around 60 or older, you dont need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security hes not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, hes cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, “Were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybodys going to get a lower rate. ” Thats not just going after places where theres abuse. Thats saying were cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more Medicare patients. This — we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I cant understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, were putting some back. Were going to give a better prescription program. Thats $1 — thats $1 for every $15 youve cut. Theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion youve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, Ive got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What impact will proposed cuts to Medicare have on current beneficiaries and the future of the program?,Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?,0.7884494,0.897971,0.6632434,0.35281116
Mitt Romney,"Regulation is essential. You cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have — I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldnt have people opening up banks in their — in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,Why is regulation important for a functioning free market economy?,"So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there — should there be more? Beginning with you. This is not a new two- minute segment to start. And well go for a few minutes, and then were going to go to health care, ok?",0.84924626,0.89998174,0.7125466,0.405582
Mitt Romney,"I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I cant afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, were thinking of dropping our insurance, we cant afford it. And the number of small businesses Ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And — and weve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2, 500 a year more than traditional insurance. So its adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2, 500 a family. Instead, its gone up by that amount. So its expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So thats one reason I dont want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I dont like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, whats been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three- quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just dont know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the — at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state; craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then lets focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2, 500 additional premium.",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,"What are the main reasons for opposing Obamacare in relation to its impact on health care costs, Medicare, and job growth?",You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?,0.8604803,0.92397535,0.7899946,0.5520729
Barack Obama,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre- existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, theyre paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they dont have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle- class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if youve got health insurance, it doesnt mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around. They cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance plan until youre 26 years old. And it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you dont have health insurance, were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point Id make before…",Pres,2012,2012-10-03,1,What improvements does the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) bring to health insurance coverage for individuals and families?,You want it repealed.

Mitt Romney,"Well, actually its — its — its a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. Thats already offered in the private marketplace. You dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But lets come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.

Mitt Romney,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and thats happening.

That doesnt restrict peoples freedom. That enhances it. And so what Ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what Ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasnt a top- down approach, Governor. What weve said is to states, well give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what Ive also said is lets hire another 100, 000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard- pressed states right now cant all do that.

I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It cant do it all, but it can make a difference.

Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by — by one another. Were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we — we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.
