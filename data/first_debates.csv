Jim Lehrer,"Good evening, and welcome to the first of 3 debates among the major candidates for president of the United States, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The candidates are; independent candidate Ross Perot, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and President George Bush, the Republican nominee. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil- Lehrer News Hour on PBS, and I will be the moderator for this 90- minute event, which is taking place before an audience in the athletic complex on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Three journalists will be asking questions tonight. They are John Mashek of The Boston Globe, Ann Compton of ABC News, and Sander Vanocur, a freelance journalist. We will follow a format agreed to by representatives of the Clinton and Bush campaigns. That agreement contains no restrictions on the content or subject matter of the questions. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement. The order of those, as well as the questioning, was determined by a drawing. The first question goes to Mr. Perot. He will have 2 minutes to answer, to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from Governor Clinton and then President Bush. Gentlemen, good evening. The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other. Mr. Perot, what do you believe tonight is the single most important separating issue of this campaign?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot. I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, a one minute response.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle- down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth. But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide. Tonight I say to the President; Mr. Bush, for 12 years youve had it your way. Youve had your chance and it didnt work. Its time to change. I want to bring that change to the American people. But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute response, sir. PRESIDENT",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience. I think weve dramatically changed the world. Ill talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind- boggling for world peace. Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. And change for change sake isnt enough. We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way were going to get it done is were going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. Ill sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change. But Id say, if you had to separate out, I think its experience at this level.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, how do you respond to the President on the — you have two minutes — on the question of experience? He says that is what distinguishes him from the other two of you.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"I believe experience counts, but its not everything. Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something. Ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. Thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. Ive gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. Ive touched more peoples lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else whos run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than theyre getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. Were living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute to respond.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I just thought of another — another big difference here between me. I dont believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him. He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams. Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economys worse than it is. But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heavens sakes. Were the United States of America. In spite of the economic problems, were the most respected economy around the world. Many would trade for it. Weve been caught up in a global slowdown. We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country thats coming apart at the seams. I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are. Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting. But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didnt in the past, because youre going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people Im listening to.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, a minute response, sir.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Well, theyve got a point. I dont have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. (Laughter. ) I dont have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime- ridden society in the industrialized world. Â But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. So, if were at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, Ive got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one. Ive got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10- minute problem. So, if its time for action, I think I have experience that counts. If theres more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, Im the wrong man.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, the question goes to you. you have two minutes. And the question is this; Are there important issues of character separating you from these other two men?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I think the American people should be the judge of that. I think character is a very important question. I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned — I put it this way; I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. I — well, maybe they say, “Well, it was a youthful indiscretion. ” I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating — its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. They get on me — Bills gotten on me about, “read my lips. ” When I make a mistake Ill admit it. But he has made — not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land — organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted. Some say, “well, youre a little old fashioned. ” Maybe I am, but I just dont think thats right. Now, whether its character or judgment — whatever it is — I have a big difference here on this issue and so well just have to see how it plays out. But I — I couldnt do that. And I dont think most Americans could do that. And they all say, “Well, it was a long time ago. ” Well, lets admit it then. Say, “I made a terrible mistake. ” How could you be Commander- in- Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say — when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, “Well, Im not going to go. The Commander- in- Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era. So there are differences but thats about the main area where I think we have a difference. I dont know about — well talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, you have one minute.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person. I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. Then, make a decision. Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there. But, I think its very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years? Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government? When youâ€™re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayerâ€™s money and youâ€™re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes. So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us. Decide who you think will do the job. Pick that person in November because believe me, as Ive said before, “The partys over and its time for the clean- up crew. ” And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge —",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0

Bill Clinton,Ross gave a good answer but Ive got to respond directly to Mr. Bush. You have questioned my patriotism.,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
George H. W. Bush,(Inaudible) .,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Bill Clinton,"You even brought some right- wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969- 70, when over 50, 000 other Americans did. Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perots service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and whos supporting me. But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking peoples patriotism he was wrong. He was wrong. And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush. Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism. I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it. Weve had enough division. I want to lead a unified country. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,We move now to the subject of taxes and spending. The question goes to Governor Clinton for a two minutes answer. It will be asked by Ann Compton.,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ann Compton,"Governor Clinton, can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle- income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or, at the very least, at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200, 000 and above. Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down. Middle- class people, defined as people with incomes of $52, 000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan- Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes. So that is where my income limit would trigger.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Ann Compton,There will be no tax increases–,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,Right. My plan –,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Ann Compton,"– below 200, 000–",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"– notwithstanding my opponents ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200, 000 and above. Then we want to give modest middle- class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60, 000. In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper- income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper- income people. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early 60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low- income housing tax credit; a long- term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. Weve got to have no more trickle down. We dont need across- the- board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say heres your tax incentive; if you create American jobs, the old- fashioned way. Id like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I dont want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and thats whats happened in the last 4 years. Were down 35, 000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and thats what I want to do.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute, sir. PRESIDENT",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"Well, let me– I have to correct one thing. I didnt question the mans patriotism. I questioned his judgment and his character. What he did in Moscow, thats fine. Let him explain it. He did. I accept that. What I dont accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your countrys at war. Im sorry. I cannot accept that. In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200, 000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200, 000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they use– were going to soak the rich- - were going to soak the rich– it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill. And so I just have a different approach. I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people. Weve got a big difference there.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, one minute. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Weve got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base. Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, its minimum- wage jobs. So weve got to really rebuild our job base. Thats going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that. Our foreign competitors are doing it; were not. We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. Were going to go through a period of shared sacrifice. Theres one challenge. Its got to be fair. Weve created a mess, dont have much to show for it and we have got to fix it. And thats about all I can say in a minute.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Okay. (APPLAUSE) Next question goes to President Bush for a 2- minute answer, and it will be asked by Sandy Vanocur. SANDER",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Sander Vanocur,"Mr. President, this past week your secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut US forces in Europe from 150 to 100 thousand by the end of September 1996. Now, why, almost 50 years after the end of World War II, and with the total collapse of the Soviet Union, should American taxpayers be taxed to support armies in Europe when the Europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is; for 40- some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"If Im poor and youre rich, and I can get you to defend me, thats good. But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share. Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe. For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. Its kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30- billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president; when they couldnt, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They dont want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made. I disagree that we need 150, 000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe. We certainly must maintain an engagement there. There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100, 000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagans former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. Were going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B- 22 airplane. Were going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply dont believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150, 000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I dont think we need 150, 000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes. He didnt tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right. We go now to Mr. Perot for a 2- minute question, and it will be asked by John Mashek.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
John Mashek,"Mr Perot, you talked about fairness just a minute ago and sharing the pain. As part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit, youve suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years. Why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Its 10 cents a year cumulative. It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year. I think “punish” is the wrong word. Again, see, I didnt create this problem. Were trying to solve it. Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3. 50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we dont have it to spend. I know its not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we dont, we will be spending our childrens money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think its fitting that were on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. Weve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. Weve got to collect the taxes to do it. If theres a fairer way, Im all ears (laughter) – aah. (Laughter and applause) But– but– see, let me make it very clear. If people dont have the stomach to fix these problems, I think its a good time to face it, November. If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. Im not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, Governor Clinton, you have a minute, sir.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think its important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one. We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit. People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people– a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years. The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists whove looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy. Thats why I think we shouldnt do it that quickly. We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work. Weve got to invest and grow. 9 Nobel Prize- winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute, sir.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"Your question was on fairness. I just disagree with Mr. Perot. I dont believe it is fair to slap a 50- cent- a- gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances. I dont think we need to do it. You see, I have a fundamental difference. I agree with what hes talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security. But hes talking tough medicine, and I think thats good. I disagree with the tax- and- spend philosophy. You see, I dont think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say thats going to make the problem better. And Im afraid thats what I think Im hearing from Governor Clinton. I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about; control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down. Hes mentioned some ways to do it– and I agree with those. Ive been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me thats a tax break for the rich. It would stimulate investment. Im for an investment tax allowance; Im for a tax break for first- time homebuyers. And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and Ill sit down with them and say lets get this done. But I do not want to go the tax- and- spend route.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, lets move on now to the subject of jobs. The first question goes to President Bush for 2 minutes, and John will ask that question.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
John Mashek,"Mr. President, last month you came to St. Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F- 15s for Saudi Arabia. In todays Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75- year- old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates. She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense- oriented industries into other purposes. How would you answer her.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes. I think its a good decision– took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And we worked it out, and indeed were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50, 000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, youre going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that were proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is; stimulate investment and savings. I mean, weve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; were ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs Ive talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer– a little longer run; its going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her its not all that gloomy; were the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. Im much more optimistic about this country than some.

Ross Perot,"Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries. Many of them are. And the sooner they start, the sooner theyll finish. And there will be a significant transition. And its very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate. We had someone who Im sure regrets said it in the presidents staff said he didnt care whether we made potato chips or computer chips. Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal. Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan. Weve given away whole industries. So as we phase these industries over, theres a whole of intellectual talent in these industries. A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and thats where the high- paying jobs are. We need to have a very carefully thought through phase- over. Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism. The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism. I cant handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later. In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0

Bill Clinton,"We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy. No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that. There are 200, 000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home. That is what I want to do. This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated. I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century– in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean- up technologies. Lets put the American people to work, and lets build the kind of high- tech, high- wage, high- growth economy that the American people deserve.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,All right. The next question goes to Mr. Perot for a 2- minute answer. It will be asked by Ann. Ann?,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ann Compton,"Mr. Perot, you talked a minute ago about rebuilding the job base. But is it true what Governor Clinton just said, that that means that unemployment will increase, that it will slow the economy? And how would you specifically use the powers of the presidency to get more people back into good jobs immediately?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, Ill get with congressional– we wont even wait till inauguration, and Ill ask the president to help me and Ill ask his staff to help me. And we will start putting together teams to put together– to take all the plans that exist and do something with them. Please understand. There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes. Its like having a blueprint for a house you never built. You dont have anywhere to sleep. Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them. Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that. The second, youve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries– have another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they dont wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schools– one on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage whove been in meetings when I would sit there and say, “Is this the one were going to talk about or do something about? ” Well, obviously, my orientation is lets go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things. Small business– youve got to have capital, youve got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches. And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0

Bill Clinton,"This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated. I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program. Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans. Until we control health care costs, were not going to control the deficit. It is the number one culprit. But first we must have an aggressive jobs program. I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bushs labor secretary said job growth has been enormous. Weve done it in Arkansas. Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America. We can do it. I know we can. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0

Ive already put forward things thatll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight– investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first- time home buyers. What Im going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, lets sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what youve done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together. Were going to have a new Congress, and were going to say to them, youve listened to the voters the way we have. Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so lets get the program through. And I believe itll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans. The plans are all over Washington. And Ive put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, its sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need. And so Ill just be asking for support to get that put into effect.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,All right. The next question goes to Governor Clinton for 2 minutes. It will be asked by Sandy.,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Sander Vanocur,"Governor Clinton, when a president running for the first time gets into the office and wants to do something about the economy, he finds in Washington theres a person who has much more power over the economy than he does; the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, accountable to no one. That being the case, would you go along with proposals made by Treasury Secretary James Brady and Congressman Lee Hamilton to make the Federal Reserve Board chairman somehow more accountable to elected officials?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works. But frankly, I dont think thats the problem today. We have low interest rates today. At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control. Our long- term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance. And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle- down economics– another across- the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment. But I think the important thing– the important thing– is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, were going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. That is my commitment. I think the American people are ready for action. I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them. Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done. Give me a chance to do that. I dont have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve. Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,President Bush you have one minute.,Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I dont think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch. There is a separation there. I think thats fine. Alan Greenspan is respected. Ive had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets. There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that. So I dont think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong. Its been very strong since Ive been president. And they recognize we got great difficulties, but theyre also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight. In terms of vetoing tax bills, youre darn right. I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress. And Im going to keep on vetoing them, because I dont think were taxed too little. I think the governments spending too much. So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants. Im going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then were going to move forward on our plan. Iâ€™ve got to protect them.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, one minute.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but lets live in a world of reality. We live in a global economy, not a national economy. These interest rates we have now dont make any sense. We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less. So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less. Its very interest sensitive. We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries. That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money. Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt. Whichever place you put it. We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control. Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term. Youd go broke in a hurry.",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,1.0

Sander Vanocur,"Mr Perot, in the postwar coldwar environment, what should be the overriding U. S. national interest? And what can the United States do, and what can it afford to do, to defend the national interest?",Pres,1992.0,1992-10-11,0.0
Ross Perot,"Again, if youre not rich, youre not a superpower. So we have two that Id put as number one. I have number 1 and 1A. One is weve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and weve got to manufacture here. Believe it or not folks, you cant ship it all overseas, youve got to make it here. And you cant convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. Weve got to make things here. You cant ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. Weve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember were thinking of many countries, now. Weve got to help them. Thats pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, weve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. Its a very unstable situation. Youve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And weve focused on the tactical. Weve made real progress there. Weve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we dont have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, weve got to be financially strong. Number two, weve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil. Because they could go back worse than things used to be. And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K. G.

First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place. We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment. We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security. Our dollars at an all time low against some foreign currencies. Were weak in the world. We must rebuild Americas strength at home. And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world. Democracies are our partners. They dont go to war with each other. Theyre reliable friends in the future.

Were the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties were having. Theres no question about that. Our exports are dramatically up. I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because theres so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS- 18, the intercontinental ballistic missile. I mean, thats been done. And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. We made dramatic progress. And so, weve got a good military. the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyâ€™re keeping the peace, and theyre respected around the world. And were more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves. We didnt listen to the nuclear freeze crowd. We said, “Peace through strength, ” and it worked and the cold war is over. And America understands that. But were so, turned so inward we dont understand the global picture. And we are helping democracy, Ross. The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and its a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.

Bill Clinton,"I think our relationships with China are important and I dont want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square. Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it. They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology. That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society. Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty. If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.

We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hills negotiation. I am the one that said lets keep the M. F. N. because you see China moving towards a free market economy. To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, youd isolate and ruin Hong Kong. They are making some progress, not enough for us. We were the first ones to put sanctions on. We still have them on, on some things. But Governor Clintons philosophy is isolate them. He says dont do it, but the policies hes expounding of putting conditions on M. F. N. and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting. And Ive stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and its moving, not as fast as wed like. But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then weve made a tremendous mistake. And Im not going to do it. And Ive had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and weâ€™re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it. And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.

Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China. Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future. It will be a growing and a closer relationship. We have a delicate, tight- wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they dont get the impression that they can suppress their people. But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress. One last point on the missiles. I dont want the American people to be confused. We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.

George H. W. Bush,"Ann, both of them are very complicated situations. And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam. I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out. We are helping. American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo. It is America thats in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia. But when you go to put somebody elses son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that theres a military plan that can do this. You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavias dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isnt going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and Im not going to do that as commander- in- chief. I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and were making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there. And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no- fly operation up there in– no- fly order up in the United Nations. Were working through the international organizations. Thats one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly– highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator. Use– work internationally to do it. I am very concerned about it. I am concerned about ethnic cleansing. I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there. But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.

We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up. This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community. Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy. But it is inappropriate for us, just because theres a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people– and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; its the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions. Its very unlike World War II, when FDRs sons flew missions. Everybody went. Its a different world now.

There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it. I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did– and I applaud that. I applaud the no- fly zone, and I know that hes going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it. I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.

Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of three 90- minute debates between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore and the Republican candidate, Governor George W.

Well have the candidates at podiums. No answer to a question can exceed two minutes. Rebuttal is limited to one minute. But as moderator I have the option to follow up and to extend any particular give and take another three- and- a- half minutes. Even then, no single answer can exceed two minutes. The candidates under their rules may not question each other directly. There will be no opening statements, but each candidate may have up to two minutes for a closing statement. The questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone. I have told no one from the two campaigns, or the Commission, or anyone else involved what they are. There is a small audience in the hall tonight. They are not here to participate, only to listen. I have asked, and they have agreed, to remain silent for the next 90 minutes.

Al Gore,"Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say Im happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bushs experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If Im entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle- class families. I believe its important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If Im entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still wont be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle- class tax cuts and retirement security.

George W. Bush,"Well, we do come from different places. I come from West Texas. The governor is the chief executive officer. We know how to set agendas. I think youll find the difference reflected in our budgets. I want to take one- half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security. One- quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one- quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills. I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut. And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponents plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically. His plan is three times larger than President Clintons proposed plan eight years ago. It is a plan that will have 200 new programs — expanded programs and creates 20, 000 new bureaucrats. It it empowers Washington.

Al Gore,"Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether its the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bushs tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, Ill put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think its very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think its very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and weve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But its now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

George W. Bush,Let me just say that obviously tonight were going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do. People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why dont we pass 1. 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government — the surplus is the governments money. Thats not what I think. I think its the hard- working people of Americas money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. Its a difference of opinion. Its a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.,Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined. I agree that the surplus is the American peoples money, its your money.

You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States. What do you mean by that?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
George W. Bush,"Actually what Ive said, Jim. Ive said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they cant get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but its time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what Ive said is that theres been some missed opportunities. Theyve had a chance. Theyve had a chance to form consensus. Ive got a plan on Medicare, for example, thats a two- stage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if youre happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, its time to get it done once and for all. Thats what Ive been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear Ill trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Moderator,One minute rebuttal.,Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
Al Gore,"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. Its not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal Im making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If youre in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponents plan for the first four or five years. Now, one thing I dont understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi- scare. Trying to frighten people in the voting booth. Its just not the way I think and its not my intentions and not my plan. I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. Thereâ€™s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If youre happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that havent kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132, 000- page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, lets come together. Youve had your chance, Vice President, youve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3. 4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D. C. Its going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Al Gore,"If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare. The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it. I would be interested to see if he would say this evening hell put Medicare in a lockbox. I donâ€™t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Â $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governors plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that hes modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. Hes 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25, 000 a year. They cant pay for their prescription drugs and so theyre some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bushs plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

The federal government should take no more than a third of anybodys check. But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If youre a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50, 000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay. Its from $4000 to about $2000.

Moderator,"I have an idea. If you have any more to say about this, you can say it in your closing statements and well move on, okay? New question. Vice President Gore. How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
Al Gore,"Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short- term component, but also a long- term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short- term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long- term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"Its an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration thats had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. Weâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise well be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that Ive worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, weve faced a lot of opposition to them. Theyve only approved about 10% of the agenda Ive helped to send up there. I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Moderator,How would you draw the difference?,Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
George W. Bush,"Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesnt believe in exploration in Alaska. Theres a lot of shut- in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. Theres an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? Im against removing dams in the northwest. I donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. Im going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short- term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, hes a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. Its time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

George W. Bush,"I dont think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and Im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. Weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.

First of all on the issue of partial birth or so- called late- term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk. Thats not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a womans right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti- choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose.

Al Gore,"Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. Its overwhelming. Milosevics government refuses to release the vote count. Theres now a general strike going on. Theyre demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so- called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, weve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that weve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism — even if they dont like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.

George W. Bush,"Well, Im pleased with the results of the election. As the vice president is. Its time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. Thats why its important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that its in his best interest and his countrys best interest to leave office. The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world. We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. Its an encouraging election.

Al Gore,"In this particular situation, no. Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, Im not sure its right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this — this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think thats the wrong thing. I think the governors instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.

George W. Bush,"Well, if its in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are — our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well- equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I dont think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think weve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in todays military is too low. Were having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well- equipped. I believe were overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. Its to make sure our troops are well- housed and well- equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high- skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.

First of all Â I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best- trained, best- equipped, best- led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world. Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my ten- year budget proposal Ive set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if weve tried every other course, if were sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now, just because we dont want to get involved everywhere doesnt mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk. I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where theres a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

A recent poll was taken among 1, 000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And its going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me. They said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we dont have a clear vision of the military, if we dont stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then were going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and Im going to prevent that.

I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years Ive served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, thats where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.

The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesnt go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bushs plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think weve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I dont think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. Ill veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. Ill give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says hes going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you wont receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. Thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, wont pay any tax at all.

The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51, 000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. Under Vice President Gores plan, they get $145 of tax relief. Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence. You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense. There is a difference of opinion.

The analysis that hes talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed. And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasnt denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10, 000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle- class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.

I want you to hear a problem weâ€™ve got here in the USA. If youre a single mother making $22, 000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200, 000 a year, and that is not right.

George W. Bush,"We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. Its about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying Im going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so- called at- risk children. Its how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they cant learn. Its a school of strong discipline and high standards. Its one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, dont put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. Thats what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. Thats my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers dont know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just wont teach and wont change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K- 2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach- for- the- children type teachers. Four, were going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to — the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.

Al Gore,"We agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. Im in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. Ive also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. Weve got to recruit 100, 000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. Weve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one- on- one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre- school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10, 000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. Im here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15- year- old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. Shes the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They cant squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

George W. Bush,"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gores plan. He says hes for voluntary testing. You cant have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. Thats the difference. You may claim youve got mandatory testing but you dont, Mr. Vice President. Thats a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because its the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? Weve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. Were going to ask you to show us whether or not — we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that wont teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that the vice presidentâ€™s running mate supports. Theres big differences. He wont support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Al Gore,"First of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and dont have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I dont think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9 30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school- age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. Were in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one- on- one time in a quality — high- quality, safe school. If its a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if its a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.

But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle- class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the — the policies and the laws to their advantage.

George W. Bush,"You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe. I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas. I remember the floods that swept our state. I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas. I have to pay the administration a compliment. James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis. But thats the time when youre tested not only — its the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down. It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted. The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them. Thats what governors do. They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Moderator,"New question. There can be all kinds of crises, Governor. A questions for you. There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution. What is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
George W. Bush,"Well, it depends, obviously. But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. Thats what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that were confronted with. In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

Al Gore,"First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas. I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out. And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts. And I agree, it works extremely well now. On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, hes a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects. I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world- wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euros value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie- breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever. But its not good enough. My attitude is you aint seen nothing yet. We need to do more and better.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

George W. Bush,"No, theres no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and thats the role of goverment to encourage that. In terms of in response to the question, no.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

Al Gore,"You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have. Its their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is weve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want — I want tax cuts for the middle- class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple- dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African- American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. Its not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. Im totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle- class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, “Just give us a chance to get up there, were going to make sure you get tax cuts. ” It didnt happen. Now hes having to say that again. Theyve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice presidents expenditures. Its been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means hell either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20, 000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Al Gore,"If I could respond, Jim. What hes quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee thats not worth the government — the taxpayer- paid paper that its printed on. Now, as for 20, 000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. It is 300, 000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the fact is youre going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. But thats not the question. The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today? And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1. 9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,I cant let the man continue with fuzzy math. It is 1. 3 trillion Mr. Vice President. It will go to everybody who pays taxes. Im not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you dont. Im not going to be a picker and chooser. What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.,Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

Moderator,"Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes. You disagree?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,0.0
Al Gore,"I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that its very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I dont go along with it. I am opposed to it. Im also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I dont think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and Ill tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million- and- a- half on my plan, which means he doesnt want you to know what hes doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. Thats the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks its the governments money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. Its a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. Its your money, its a part of your retirement benefit. Its a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say theres a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2. 3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If were smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
Al Gore,"Here is the difference. I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governors plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount thats diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, thats too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. Thats how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor — I know were not supposed to ask each other questions — but Id be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"No. Theres enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security. The trillion comes from the surplus. Surplus is money — more money than needed. Let me tell you what your plan is. Its not Social Security plus, its Social Security plus huge debt. That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. Its time to have a leader that doesnt put off tomorrow what we should do today. Its time to have somebody to step up and say look, lets let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. Thats twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. Its a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and thats exactly what Im going to do.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0

If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.",Pres,2000.0,2000-10-03,1.0
George W. Bush,"This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory. Its not. This is a government that says younger workers cant possibly have their own assets. We need to think differently about the issue. We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made. If we dont trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.

I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, “No controlling legal authority. ” I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe that — I believe theyve moved that sign, “The buck stops here” from the Oval Office desk to “The buck stops here” on the Lincoln bedroom. Its not good for the country and its not right. We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. Theres a huge trust. I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I dont want you to let me down again. And we can do better than the past administration has done. Its time for a fresh start. Its time for a new look. Its time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.

And thats one of the reasons Ive said before, and Ill pledge here tonight, if Im president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain- Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason its that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patients bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.

We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle- class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D. C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, its the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well- connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.

Tonights 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15- minute segments with two- minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates. The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two- minute closing statements. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent — no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (LAUGHTER) You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weve been, but where were going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that well be better off. Ive got a different view. I think weve got to invest in education and training. I think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters — to you — which path we should take. Are we going to double on top- down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And Im looking forward to having that debate.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"Thank you, Jim. Its an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. Im pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. Im sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here — here with me. So I… (LAUGHTER) Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. Ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, “Ive been out of work since May. Can you help me? ” Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, “Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part- time jobs. Hes lost his most recent job and weve now just lost our home. Can you help us? ” And the answer is, yes, we can help, but its going to take a different path. Not the one weve been on, not the one the president describes as a top- down, cut taxes for the rich. Thats not what Im going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. Were far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. Its small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30- year low.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"Now, Im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more — if you will, trickle- down government — would work. Thats not the right answer for America. Ill restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle- down — his trick- down approach, as he said yours is.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weve got to improve our education system and weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. Weve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100, 000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years. But I also believe that weve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things Im sure well be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where theres a difference, because Governor Romneys central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut — on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts — thats another trillion dollars — and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for. Thats $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle- class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that youd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"Well, sure. Id like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I dont have a $5 trillion tax cut. I dont have a tax cut of a scale that youre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But Im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high- income people. High- income people are doing just fine in this economy. Theyll do fine whether youre president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the presidents policies, middle- income Americans have been buried. Theyre just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4, 300. This is a — this is a tax in and of itself. Ill call it the economy tax. Its been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2, 500 a family. Middle- income families are being crushed.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"And so the question is how to get them going again. And Ive described it. Its energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the — the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas Ill just note. First, education. I agree; Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. Weve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U. S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If Im president, Ill double them, and also get the — the oil from offshore and Alaska. And Ill bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. Im going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, Im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the — the revenues going to the government. My — my number- one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that; no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle- income Americans. And I — and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high- income Americans. So any — any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Mr. President?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, I think — lets talk about taxes, because I think its instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle- class families. And thats exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle- class families by about $3, 600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college, which means theyre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that hes been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnt been able to identify them. But Im going to make an important point here, Jim.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper- income individuals can — are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you dont come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"And thats why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romneys pledge of not reducing the deficit or — or — or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle- class families. The average middle- class family with children would pay about $2, 000 more. Now, thats not my analysis. Thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And — and that kind of top — top- down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250, 000 tax break, while middle- class families are burdened further, thats not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, Id say absolutely not. Im not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What Ive said is I wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. Thats part one. So theres no economist that can say Mitt Romneys tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high- income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know its a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but its just not the case. Look, Ive got five boys. Im used to people saying something thats not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping Ill believe it. But that — that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high- income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle- income families. I will lower taxes on middle- income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by $3, 000 to $4, 000 on middle- income families. There are all these studies out there. But lets get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And youd think, well, then why lower the rates?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Thats where we started. Yeah. Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, for 18 months hes been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, hes saying that his big, bold idea is, “Never mind. ” And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high- income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. Its — its math. Its arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small- business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250, 000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under — under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyre the job creators, theyd be burdened. But under Governor Romneys definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything, but — but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"You bet. Well, President, youre — Mr. President, youre absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half — half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one- quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and — and Ive talked to a guy who has a very small business. Hes in the electronics business in — in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700, 000 jobs. I dont want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles- Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. Thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"Jim, I — you may want to move onto another topic, but I — I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion — just to give you a sense, over 10 years, thats more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well- to- do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romneys plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth. Look, weve tried this. Weve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"Bill Clinton tried the approach that Im talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle- class families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"I think first of all, let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what I said. Im not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. Thats not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. Thats point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thats not my plan. Number two, lets look at history. My plan is not like anything thats been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. Theyre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. Its absolutely extraordinary. Weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. Its just — its — weve got — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right. Lets talk — were still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you — you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"Good. Im glad you raised that, and its a — its a critical issue. I think its not just an economic issue, I think its a moral issue. I think its, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt were adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The presidents would — president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they dont pass it; Is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, Ill get rid of it. Obamacares on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

But Im not going to — Im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. Thats number one. Number two, Ill take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"Number three, Ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The president said hed cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion- dollar deficits for the last four years. The presidents put it in place as much public debt — almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Barack Obama,"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion- dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from; two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what weve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a Great Depression, but what weve also said is, lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werent working very well, 18 government — 18 government programs for education that were well- intentioned, not werent helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. Thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that weve got to do more. And so Ive put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. Its on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2. 50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles- Simpson commission. Well, thats how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me just finish their point, because youre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.

You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion- dollar deficits every year. That doesnt get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is it that I dont want to raise taxes? Why dont I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, “Look, Im going to extend the tax policies that we have now; Im not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when were in recession, you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone. ” Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just dont want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is its not just wealthy people — you mentioned Donald Trump. Its not just Donald Trump youre taxing. Its all those businesses that employ one- quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. Thats why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700, 000 jobs. I dont want to kill jobs in this environment. Ill make one more point.

Barack Obama,"There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. Hes ruled out revenue. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,Absolutely. (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. Thats how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, youll never get there. Youll never balance the budget by raising taxes. Spain — Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. Were now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I dont want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because theyre working.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"But — but Mr. President, youre saying in order to — to get the job done, its got to be balanced. Youve got to have… (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"If — if were serious, weve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Lets talk about corporate taxes. Now, Ive identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they dont get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when theyre making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldnt we want to eliminate that? Why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasnt identified which ones they are — but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but Ive actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesnt make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me — shes got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks shes got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. Theyre using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. Thats not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, were going to have to make some decisions. And if were asking for no revenue, then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, were talking about potentially a 30 — a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, thats a big problem. And governors are creative. Theres no doubt about it. But theyre not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"Jim, lets — weve gone on a lot of topics there, and so its going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Come back to… (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"… to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So lets go through them one by one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2. 8 billion a year. And its actually an accounting treatment, as you know, thats been in place for a hundred years. Now…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,Its time to end it.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but thats about 50 years worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2. 8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2. 8 billion is on the table. Of course its on the table. Thats probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent. But dont forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years worth of breaks, into — into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you dont just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this — this is not — this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, Ive been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what youre talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,But — but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"What we do have right now is a setting where Id like to bring money from overseas back to this country. And, finally, Medicaid to states? Im not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, youre going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then youre going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors — Republican and Democrats — said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor. So — so lets state — one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Dont have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this. And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First — first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, weve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. Its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic Speaker Tip ONeill. But it is — the basic structure is sound. But — but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because thats the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother — some of you know — helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And thats the perspective I bring when I think about whats called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks whove worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long- term deficits, but to do that, lets look where some of the moneys going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a — make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the — throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Well follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if youre 60 or around 60 or older, you dont need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security hes not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, hes cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, “Were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybodys going to get a lower rate. ” Thats not just going after places where theres abuse. Thats saying were cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more Medicare patients. This — we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I cant understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, were putting some back. Were going to give a better prescription program. Thats $1 — thats $1 for every $15 youve cut. Theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion youve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, Ive got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Barack Obama,"First of all, I think its important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. Its called premium support, but its understood to be a voucher program. His running mate…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,And you dont support that?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0

Barack Obama,I understand.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"… people, right, not for current retirees.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"For — so if youre — if youre 54 or 55, you might want to listen cause this — this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6, 000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is hell maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But theres still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, whatll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"And then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I dont think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own — only my opinion. AARP thinks that the — the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, “Obamacare, ” if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. Theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier. And I dont think thats the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Well talk about — specifically about health care in a moment. But what — do you support the voucher system, Governor?",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,What I support is no change for current retirees and near- retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,And what about the vouchers? (CROSSTALK),Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"So thats — thats number one. Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose — and theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they dont have to pay additional money, no additional $6, 000. Thats not going to happen. Theyll have at least two plans.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is Id rather have a private plan. Id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. Id rather be able to have an insurance company. If I dont like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, were going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. Thats the plan that Ive put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, whos the co- author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill — Bill Clintons chief of staff. This is an idea thats been around a long time, which is saying, hey, lets see if we cant get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. Thats what they do. And so youve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romneys proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then theyre stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

And whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term, youve seen regulation become excessive, and its hurt — its hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss thats been given to — to New York banks Ive ever seen.

Jim Lehrer,"No, lets not. Lets let him respond — lets let him respond to this specific on Dodd- Frank and what the governor just said.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Barack Obama,"I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasnt just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were — that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given, because the folks didnt qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they werent. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said youve got — banks, youve got to raise your capital requirements. You cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. Weve going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so — so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd- Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is; Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But thats not what I believe.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"Sorry, but thats just not — thats just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. Thats why Id have regulation. But I wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. Thats one of the unintended consequences of Dodd- Frank. It wasnt thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks. Theyre getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd- Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified. Thats exactly right. Its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd- Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didnt ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. Its been two years. We dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. Its hurt the housing market because Dodd- Frank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. Its not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation. I will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, lets move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And its a two- minute new — new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Jim Lehrer,You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?,Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,0.0
Mitt Romney,"I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I cant afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, were thinking of dropping our insurance, we cant afford it. And the number of small businesses Ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And — and weve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2, 500 a year more than traditional insurance. So its adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2, 500 a family. Instead, its gone up by that amount. So its expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So thats one reason I dont want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I dont like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, whats been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three- quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just dont know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the — at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state; craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then lets focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2, 500 additional premium.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Barack Obama,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre- existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, theyre paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they dont have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle- class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if youve got health insurance, it doesnt mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around. They cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance plan until youre 26 years old. And it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you dont have health insurance, were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point Id make before…",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

It hasnt destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"Well, I did with my first statement. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary — elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didnt raise taxes. Youve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didnt cut Medicare. Of course, we dont have Medicare, but we didnt cut Medicare by $716 billion.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"We didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive. We didnt also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put — put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people dont want Medicare — dont want Obamacare. Its why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had — had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say its the same plan. It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that weve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and thats been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They — they say, if a patients coming in, lets get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes. Lets — lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve — theyve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, lets use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — its true — but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So were already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, youre already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, Im just going to repeal it, but — but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with, other than saying were going to leave it to the states.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a pre- existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.

Mitt Romney,"Well, actually its — its — its a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. Thats already offered in the private marketplace. You dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But lets come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. (CROSSTALK)",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and thats happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Mitt Romney,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. Thats the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"Let me just point out first of all this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given. Thats explicitly prohibited in the law. But lets go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isnt what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve — if its been under 90 days. But thats already the law and that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. Theres a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasnt a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that “insurers, youve got to take everybody. ” Now, that also means that youve got more customers. But when — when Governor Romney says that hell replace it with something, but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0
Barack Obama,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. Thats how its going to be paid for, but we dont know the details. He says that hes going to replace Dodd- Frank, Wall Street reform, but we dont know exactly which ones. He wont tell us. He now says hes going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because theyre too good? Is it — is it because that somehow middle- class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre- existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and weve got to make choices. And the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle- class families all across the country.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"Which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say, “Its my way or the highway, ” I dont get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip ONeill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. Youve said the same thing, youre going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle- income families. And Im going to work together with Congress to say, ok, what — what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25, 000, $50, 000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high- income people. Thats one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles- Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre- existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on — on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre- existing conditions. Thats part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

That doesnt restrict peoples freedom. That enhances it. And so what Ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what Ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasnt a top- down approach, Governor. What weve said is to states, well give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what Ive also said is lets hire another 100, 000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard- pressed states right now cant all do that. In fact weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesnt think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It cant do it all, but it can make a difference.

Mitt Romney,"First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of Americas military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by — by one another. Were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we — we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what were seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle- down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And its not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.

The federal government can get local and — and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is Ive added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I — these are disabled kids or — or — or poor kids or — or lower- income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.

You know, his — his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romneys talked about. And it wasnt very detailed. This seems to be a trend.

That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether its two- year or four- year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, “Why not cut out the middleman? ” And as a consequence, what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, “you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, ” you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just dont have that option.

A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for Americas government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Lets grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a — to a school that hes being more successful. I dont want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, Ive had that experience. I dont just talk about it. Ive been there.

(LAUGHTER) But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middle- class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. Thats how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. Thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause. Thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. Thats how we repealed “dont ask/dont tell. ” Thats how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and thats how were going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Thats how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. So weve — weve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.

Number two, whats important is occasionally youve got to say no, to — to — to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when — when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When — when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Barack Obama,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And Ive got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Barack Obama,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver. You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that theyre helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that Ive tried to do, and everything that Im now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is — is channeled and — and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybodys getting a fair shot. And everybodys getting a fair share — everybodys doing a fair share, and everybodys playing by the same rules. You know, four years ago, I said that Im not a perfect man and I wouldnt be a perfect president. And thats probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks Ive kept. But I also promised that Id fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. Ive kept that promise and if youll vote for me, then I promise Ill fight just as hard in a second term.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Mitt Romney,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is a — this is an important election and Im concerned about America. Im concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I — I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. Its bigger than our respective parties. Its an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month were going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. Were talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And its not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. Theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected youll continue to see a middle- class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. Ill get incomes up again. Youll see chronic unemployment. Weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If Im president I will create — help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the presidents reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. Youre going to see health premiums go up by some $2, 500 per family. If Im elected we wont have Obama. Well put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and well focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected youre going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. Youll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. Youll have hospital and providers thatll no longer accept Medicare patients. Ill restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The presidents reelected youll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get Americas middle class working again. Thank you, Jim.",Pres,2012.0,2012-10-03,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the Bushnell Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut. Im Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to the first of the 1996 Presidential debates between President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee. This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will last 90 minutes following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns. There will be two- minute opening and closing statements. In between, a series of questions, each having three parts. A 90- second answer, a 60- second rebuttal, and a 30- second response. I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits with the help of a series of lights visible to both. Under their rules, the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. I will ask the questions. There are no limitations on the subjects. The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss. Now, to the opening statements and to President Clinton. Mr. President.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Thank you, Jim. And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now theres a record; Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Lets keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, lets balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now lets pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now lets expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100, 000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now lets keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now lets move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, lets make education our highest priority so that every eight- year- old will be able to read, every 12- year- old can log onto the Internet, every 18- year- old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st Century. And I look forward to discussing exactly how were going to do it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bob Dole,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words. Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching. Its a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee. Im very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents. I have three very special people with me tonight; My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back. Ive learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you cant go it alone. And thats what America is all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian . And ever since that time, Ive tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. America is the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job. Now, Im a plain- speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that Ill try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.

Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, first question. There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100, 000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. Ive worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V- chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when theyre young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug- free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Dole, one minute.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people. The President trusts the government. We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people. One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1. 5 trillion. Dont forget that, that happened in 1993. A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America. Not just the rich. If you made 25, 000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people. Thats my difference with the President. Well have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive- by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum- Kennedy bill, which says you cant lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your familys been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,I agree with that. Thats right.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"And I may be better off four years from now, but I dont know. I looked at the slowest growth in the century. He inherited a growth of 4. 7 4. 8 percent, now its down to about 2. 4 percent. Were going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. Weve got stagnant wages. In fact, womens wages have dropped 2. 2 percent. Mens wages havent gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? Theyre working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off. They talk about family income being up. Thats not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And its up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. Were going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. Thats what America is all about.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"One minute, Mr. President.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape its been in in 30 years. We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses. We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995. The average familys income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think its clear that were better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still. How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children. Thats what I want to focus on. But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Senator Dole.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"I doubt that I acknowledged that this year. But in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. Its not whether were better off, its whether theyre better off. Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. Are your children getting a better education. Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down but its because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City. So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, theyll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Absolutely not. Lets look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Doles been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldnt work at the time. Thats what he said. Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out- of- pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole- Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Doles, even his own friends, his campaign co- chair, Senator DAmato, says that they cant possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And well have time to deal with the long- term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Senator Dole.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But Ive supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all Ive got is my Social Security and my Medicare, dont cut it. I wouldnt violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. Im concerned about healthcare. Ive had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but weve got to fix it. Its his trustees, the Presidents trustees, not mine, who says its going to go broke. He doesnt fix it for ten years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. Youve already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think its time to have a truce.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Mr. President.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, let me say, first of all, Id be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the 83 Social Security commission. But it wont be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co- chair, Senator DAmato, says hell have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission. But Senator Doles plans are not good for the country.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,I need it.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, the people need it, thats the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across — lets take a family making $30, 000 a year, thats $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that its not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, thats four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; its may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but its a six- point package. First of all, its a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. Its balancing a budget by the year 2002. Its a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. Its a state tax relief. Its a $500 per child tax credit. Its about litigation reforms. Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesnt like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think weve got a case here. And its also regulatory reform. Its a good package, Mr. President. Wed like to have your support.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,"Well, heres the problem with it; It sounds very good, but theres a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Doles friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says its not a practical program. Its a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. Its not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, thats the right way to go.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14 percent, thats how simple it is. I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. Were talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.

Bill Clinton,"Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether theyre going to support me or not. The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think thats what hes talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didnt want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldnt make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but were going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, Ill sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. Ive done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know its right for the country over the long run. Thats what Ive tried to do and thats what I will continue to do as president.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

I look at the trial lawyers, and when youre a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D. C. and puts 35 million into the pot. Now, if these arent special interests, Ive got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th. The trial lawyers and I dont — you know, my wifes a lawyer. Were the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But were lawyers, I like lawyers. I dont dislike trial lawyers. But it seemed to me theres got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and theres got to be some cap on punitive damage. Youre putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.

Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasnt me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.

Bob Dole,"I think its very difficult. Lets be honest about it. Thats why we need campaign finance reform. Thats why I reach out to the Perot voters. Weve done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in 92, its all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldnt get it done, because I wasnt enforceable. Youve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. Thats how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and thats not how its going to work. But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the Presidents been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And Ive had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasnt until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent — marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesnt work that way. So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"Mr. Lehrer, I hope well have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program. But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested — a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Doles ardent supporters, Senator McCain, whos out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Doles own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain- Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Get people who dont have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress. Now, were now kidding anybody, Mr. President. These are sophisticated people watching tonight. Millions and millions of Americans. They know the Republican Party hasnt done it. They know the Democratic party wont do it.

Bill Clinton,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about whats happened. I am. But lets look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four- star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nations drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug- free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still dont understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I dont think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I dont think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isnt dangerous and wont kill them and wont destroy their lives, get the message and change.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

You dont want to politicize drugs, but its already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this. I mean, you say weve done all these bad things, which isnt the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czars office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean thats what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, were going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon — or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I wont comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs. But it seems to me the kids ought to — if theyve started, they ought to stop and just dont do it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it. And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug- free schools act. I dont think that means youre soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what its like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the governments role. If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"Not if I didnt have a better idea. But Ive got a better idea. Its something Ive worked on for 15 years. Its called the automated check or the instant check. Its being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You dont buy any gun. You dont get any gun. Weve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D. C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. Ive been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you dont get any gun. You dont get a hand gun, you dont get a rifle, you dont get a shot gun, you get zippo. If were going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, weve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. Theyve appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe its a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps thats another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady — only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street. Lets get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,"Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether hed be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if thats true Im grateful for it. But lets look at the facts here. The Brady Bill has kept at least 60, 000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didnt succeed and I signed it and Im glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didnt want the assault weapons ban, just like they didnt want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobodys lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. Weve expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country. So Im glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, the President doesnt have it quite right. I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective. But thats history. I told the NRA thats history. Youre not going to worry about it anymore. Im not going to worry about it anymore. Lets do something better. Lets stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President. Talking about this and this. You add all the states thatve used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals. It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and well get the instant check passed and well keep guns out of the hands of criminals.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,"If he, thats what he said, hes not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the worlds strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things; Number one, weve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. Weve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. Weve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand Americas economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And thats one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Senator.,Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"Well, I have a different view. Again, Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand its been extended til some time next year. But, lets start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didnt have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. They didnt have the weapons, they didnt have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didnt get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. Its called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didnt have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the presidents found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. Theres no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We havent done that. Were way behind, which means Americans cant come home. Americans shouldnt have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and lets not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there. Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia its a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. And institutions are beginning to function. In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this whole world. But if were moving in the right direction and America is leading, were better off.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U. S. troops into harms way.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided. Hes deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. Its cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace- keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander- in- Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position. Then Im going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now weve got a problem. Weve got to go back and look. Its just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. You may have said that, too. But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and were going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but lets do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six- year period. We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system. I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training. That is my solemn obligation. You ask when do you decide to deploy them. The interests of the American people must be at stake. Our values must be at stake. We have to be able to make a difference. And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform. But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Husseins threatened invasion of Kuwait. When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits. When weve worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat. I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Weve sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war. We lost 53, 000 Americans. We shouldnt be doing any favors for North Korea. Its a closed society. We dont have any inspection. We dont know whether its going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. Someone called them something else. Incentives. We dont know whats going to happen. Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.

Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban- American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms- Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though theyre effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Thats the point I made. We have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba. Its a haven for drug smugglers and we dont have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro. In my view, the policy has failed. So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, Im going to sign it but Im going to try to change it next year. A lot of these election- year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996. And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment. When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system. When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7, 000 a year. This is a serious business. Its about your family; its about your business, and in this case its about a firmer policy with Cuba.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"There were several off- the- subject quaffers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didnt hike. And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the 82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation- adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bob Dole,"Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and well have a fairer and flatter system and were going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one- seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1. 5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. Theyre going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We wont threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum- Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. Weve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasnt satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, youre going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didnt want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, Im proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, that sounds very good, but its very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh 93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the 94 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but were pursuing a step- by- step reform now. The Kennedy- Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their familys been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive- by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Doles Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that — my provisions, like deductions for long- term care, making certain that self- employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums. You can also deduct long- term care now, so its a good its a good start. I think theres enough — were even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,"Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U. N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and weve been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit. I certainly didnt feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding whats called the no- fly zone by increasing our allies control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that you give him an inch hell take a mile. We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Were even shipping 3, 000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. Its a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million- two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. Theyre always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5, 000 troops coming, they didnt even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U. N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before youd call somebody to America, youd have some notion what the end result might be. Now maybe its better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have started again today. But again its almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. Its ad hoc, its sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what countrys in trouble, well have a meeting. Now, to me thats not the strategy that I think people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship. Weve lost credibility around the world. Our allies know, — theyre not certain what were going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.

It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And there is , so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say lets stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus. Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and theyve started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

The killing and tragedies had taken place. And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it. It shouldnt be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent. And I dont intend to politicize it. I hope they talked and I hope theyve reached some result and that the killing will end.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where youre on your own, end quote. Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"Well, Im saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that. Hes troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. Thats why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And thats why weve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. Thats why were moving in the right direction. And Im trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. Thats why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. Thats why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but its got to be paid for. Thats why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future. I think Americas best days are still ahead, but weve got to build the right bridge.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

So we always had a rule, we divided by six. Maybe in your case maybe just two. But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President cant take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether thats happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether its drug use or something else in America. So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better. When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future. I also want a bridge to the truth. We have to tell the truth. Weve got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth. And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America. We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and well have that soon.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem. But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future. Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education. If he gets elected president, well start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children. I personally dont think thats the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"Yes. I didnt favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carters election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99. 5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, youre a Republican, you cant be reaching out to these people. Ive reached out to people all my life. Ive worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. Im not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation thats raised about $10 million for the disabled. I dont advertise it. Just did, havent before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, youre going to get to go to school because were going to match what the state puts up, and youre going to go to the school of your choice. I dont fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I dont criticize them. But why shouldnt everybody have that choice. Why shouldnt low income Americans and low middle income Americans. Im excited about it. Its going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"Let me say first of all, Im all for students having more choices. Weve worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill. Theres funds for 3, 000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, theyre free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well. What Im against is Senator Doles plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If were going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug- free schools. He voted against these programs, he does not believe it. Thats the issue. 90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those Ive outlined in this campaign.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Id better correct the President. I dont know what time it is, but its probably getting late. I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldnt have had and we probably voted no. Ive supported all the education programs. Ive supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it. So I dont want anybody out there to think weve just been voting no, no, no. Lets give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools. Lets not, lets help, lets turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Mr. President, what is wrong with the school choice proposal?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bill Clinton,"I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3, 000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance. But if youre going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where theyre raising and spending most of the money. I simply think its wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just dont believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50, 000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. Thats a fact. Thats one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if thats one of your successes, I wouldnt speak about it too loudly. It costs about $27, 000 to pay people to volunteer. Weve got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasnt gone down. And you pick out 20, 000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. Im a product of a public school. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. Youre not for school choice, you cant be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99. 5 percent of the money, we dont know what happened to the other . 5 percent, were looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats. And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just cant do. Youre for school uniforms and curfews and youre opposed to truancy. Now thats not reform, Mr. President. Why cant Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. Some schools arent safe. Some schools arent even safe. Your choice is nothing. Lets give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America. If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, lets start with education.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"First of all, Senator Dole, lets set the record straight. I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And Ive worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there. You, its amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we dont have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and thats why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote, it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self- serving schemes, end quote. Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,0.0
Bob Dole,"I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies whove never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldnt be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people. Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. Weve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education. Now the reason they dont have, The reason the President cant support this is pretty obvious. Its not taking anything away from schools, its new money. Its not being taken away from anybody else, except well downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, thats what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There wont be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people whove made it and know the hard knocks in life.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

And you know this liberal charge, thats what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. Its sort of their golden oldie, you know. Its a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just dont think that dog will hunt this time. The American people should make up their own mind. Heres the record; We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War — I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. Weve got ten and a half million new jobs; weve got record numbers of those new small businesses. Weve made every one of them eligible for a tax cut. Weve got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100, 000 police and the assault weapons ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether thats a liberal record or a record thats good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, I think its pretty liberal, Ill put that label on it. You take a look at all the programs youve advocated, Mr. President. Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said weve got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldnt buy that. I remember talking by the telephone. Im not even certain you were too excited about that. I wont, I never repeat what Ive talked to the President about. In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think weve done a good job.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

I dont believe in discrimination. I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a government thats smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless. Its inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is Ive reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women. It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative wont make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadnt stopped it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bob Dole,"Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record. Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I dont mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal. Ive just finished reading a book, I think its called — what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration. Whether its organized labor or whether its the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether its the labor unions or whatever. And so I think you take a look at it. The bottom line is this; I think the American people, thought hed recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know whats going to happen to them. Theyve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? Thats why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. Thats what our message is to the people watching. Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0
Bill Clinton,"The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut — and let me talk about the education tax cut — to let people have a $10, 000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody. And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, thats the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bob Dole,"Let me say first, on the Presidents promise for another tax cut. I mean, Ive told people as Ive traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in 96 and not many hands go up. So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent. The people want economic reform. Theyre having a hard time making ends meet. Youve got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family. This is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. Its about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer. When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money. I think the government can do better.

Its about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America. And not about personal things. You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it.

But the important thing is, what are we going to do now. I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure weve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two- thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme. Now, remember, folks, even Senator Doles campaign co- chair here, Senator DAmato, says hes got to cut Medicare to pay for this. Everybody whos looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say its bad for the economy. Its going to blow a hole in the deficit Its going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.

You didnt even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president. It wasnt until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts. Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and thats the question of pardons. I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show. And Ive never discussed Whitewater, as Ive told you personally. Im not discussing Whitewater now.

Let me say what Ive said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue theyve brought up. Its under, theres been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. I will tell you this; I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.

I dont know, Im not questioning anybody. But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period. And I think he made a mistake. And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake. But apparently his position hasnt changed. If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I havent gotten into any of these things, as the President knows. Weve had that discussion. And again I know Senator DAmato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I cant remember, but hes not my general chairman, hes a friend of mine.

They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses. So Id rather talk about my strengths. And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. Its a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all youve got going in this campaign is fear. Youre spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator dont cut my Medicare. Im trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and thats been my career in the United States Senate. And Ill keep my word on the economic package. If I couldnt cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldnt look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.

A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work. Now we have to create those jobs, now that were requiring people to go do work. A commitment to continuing step- by- step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while. A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment. Thats what Id like them to know about me; that Ive gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true. And I believe weve got the results to show were on the right track. The most important thing is, I believe weve got the right ideas for the future.

I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something. President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said hes going to fill out his term, but he didnt. Hes president so I guess its a little better deal. But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something. I wasnt just getting more power and more power. So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line. We can give you all these numbers, they dont mean a thing. If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you cant have medical care, or youre holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next? You know, Americas best days are ahead of us. Ive seen the tough times, I know they can be better and Ill lead America to a brighter future.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bill Clinton,"Lets look at that. When I ran for president, I said wed cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs. Were number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said wed put, pass a crime bill that would put 100, 000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that. I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed wed moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities. I said wed get tougher with child support and child support enforcements up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I think theyre better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down. Republicans talk about it, but were the first the first administration in anybodys lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now Ive got a plan thats been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldnt take that. But well get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan Ive laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if youll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

Bob Dole,"Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did. He didnt do all these things. Lets take all these four years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didnt like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S & L crisis was over, theyre starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work. He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. Theyre gone. The governments bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says its not. In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion. So lets just, lets give credit where credit is due. Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland. A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.

Bill Clinton,"Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance youve given us to appear. I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and Ive done my best to be faithful to the charge youve given me. Im proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. And Im glad were going in the right direction. And Ive done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century. Id like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesnt happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because were number one in auto production again. All the people Ive met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.",Pres,1996.0,1996-10-06,1.0

I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because theyre the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century. Theyre the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that its not going to be the same. Youre not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people. And thats what youre faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with. Its important, its their future. And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up. And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just dont do it. And I know that Im someone older than you. But Ive had my anxious moments in my life. Ive learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. Im standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited. I know who I am, and I know where Im from, and I know where I want to take America. We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.

Dorothy Ridings,"Good evening from the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville, Kentucky. Im Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonights first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale. Tonights debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nations highest office in face- to- face debate. Our panelists are James Wieghart, national political correspondent for Scripps- Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer, correspondent for the CBS program “60 Minutes;” and Fred Barnes, national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun. Barbara Walters of ABC News, who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate, is our moderator. Barbara.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Barbara Walters,"Thank you, Dorothy. A few words as we begin tonights debate about the format. The position of the candidates — that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement — was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates. Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement. It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first. I hope thats clear. If it isnt, it will become clear as the debate goes on. Further, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called “Mr. President” and “Mr. Mondale. ” Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues. The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel. In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question. Then — and this is important — each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak. And now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate. The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred. And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart. Mr. Wieghart. The Nations Economy",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
James Wieghart,"Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people — in your campaign — a balanced budget by 1983. Weve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years youve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight? The President. I have a plan — not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981. It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us — the double- digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget — no, that was no longer possible. So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy. Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates. Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs — there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military. So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending — the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
James Wieghart,"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines arent about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion. In view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good? The President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasnt going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place. But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent — were not far from there — by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4- percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean — without an increase in tax rates — that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet. Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
James Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, the Carter- Mondale administration didnt come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term. You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two- thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, theyve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether well deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that Ive heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesnt converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates — the real cost of interest — will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that were moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy thats fair. Ive stood up and told the American people that I think its a real problem, that it can destroy long- term economic growth, and Ive told you what I think should be done. I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
James Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isnt it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things — [applause] — that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and Im not going to do it that way. The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7, 000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And thats why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the Presidents recommendations.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,"I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates. And now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal. THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Yes. I dont believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nations history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, youre taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down governments share of what it is taking. With regard to Social Security, I hope therell be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this; A President should never say “never. ” But Im going to violate that rule and say “never. ” I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,Mr. Mondale?,Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"Well, thats exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980 He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent — reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying — with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened. Theres a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,"Thank you very much. Well now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer. Ms. Sawyer? Leadership Qualities",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Dianne Sawyer,"Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the others leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondales leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government. Id like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims — Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what Im saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long- term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes thats the case. I do, and Im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair. I think thats what leadership is all about. Theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when theres a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time — and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen — once, and sometimes twice — the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. Its the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is whats needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And thats why in this campaign Im telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Dianne Sawyer,"You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"Well, I think were getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Dianne Sawyer,"Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondales campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since youve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25- percent cut in Social Security — before I get to the answer to your question — the only 25- percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society — that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society. Now, having that, I think also that in leadership — well, I believe that you find people, positions such as Im in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I dont believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding whos going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job. But I also believe something else about that. I believe that — and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office — that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I dont want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people — is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue. Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they werent to be abhorred — that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Dianne Sawyer,"As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could — a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign — that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old- age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them. THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what weve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and were going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and were taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,"Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"Well, I guess Im reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, “Its not what he doesnt know that bothers me; its what he knows for sure that just aint so. ” [Laughter] The fact of it is; The Presidents budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. Its not an opinion; its a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, “What do you want to cut in the budget? ” , he said, “Cut those things I asked for but didnt get. ” Thats Social Security and Medicare. The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the Presidents budget sought to terminate. So, if hed had his way, there wouldnt have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal- assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,Mr. President? THE,Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter- Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldnt solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which Id asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution. And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Ronald Reagan,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, “born again, ” so I dont know whether I would fit that — that particular term. But I have — thanks to my mother, God rest her soul — the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I dont believe — I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not — I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer. At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign — or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondales running mate said I wasnt a good Christian. So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I dont believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Ronald Reagan,"The answer to your question is very simple about why I dont go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut — were supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand — but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church. I know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I dont feel — and my minister knows this and supports me in this position — I dont feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Walter Mondale,"First of all, I accept President Reagans affirmation of faith. Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I dont know if Ive been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I dont know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. Its probably the reason that Im in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think were all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use ones own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that thats a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, were going to have a religious test for judges before theyre selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think thats an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth — more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth — and its because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. Thats why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue — as I do — to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"No. What I object to — [applause] — what I object to — what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others. A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. Its when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political — or private religious faith and the use of the state is where — for the most personal decisions in American life — thats where I draw the line.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Barbara Walters,"Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal. THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Yes, its very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cant do it because its school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that. With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court; Sandra Day OConnor. Ill stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, Ill do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Walter Mondale,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life. Lets take the example that the President cites. I believe in prayer. My family prays. Weve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur? It seems to me that a moments reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We dont want that.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

James Wieghart,"After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter] Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue- collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap — the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing. Id like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"My answer is that this campaign isnt over yet. And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. The American people want arms control. They dont want this arms race. And they dont want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know its got to come down. And if it wont come down, the economys going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because its unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that peoples lives and health are being risked, because weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap thats widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, were all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.

The President answers that it didnt happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think its going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, again, Im running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondales running away from his. But Im running on the record of what we have asked for. Well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6. 1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago — I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one- third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with — if it did that much — with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did — 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education — on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw; The leadership isnt taking us where we want to go.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual cant create the kind of environment that he might like.

Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down — or since weve kept records — 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that weve had. I think that weve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5- year program — but its just about finished already — a billion dollars. And now were going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.

And Im very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government. The President just said that his government is shrinking. Its not. Its now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.

There are some other things that have been said here — back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double- digit inflation and the 21\1/2\- percent interest rates of the Carter- Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.

Dianne Sawyer,"Id like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences — and that is abortion and right to life. Im exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy. First, Mr. President. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work — what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be prolife? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is — theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, its a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying — I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious — there were clerics there — everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown- up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then- Democratic Governor — signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isnt it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, thats murder? And it used the term “death of the unborn child. ” So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine — and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Dianne Sawyer,"A two- part followup. Do I take it from what youve said about the platform, then, that you dont regard the language and dont regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices — that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do. Now, it is a sin if youre taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo- Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self- defense. And therefore, Ive always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Dianne Sawyer,"Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin?

Walter Mondale,"This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, wont work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. Thats always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges whove been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I dont think so, and I think its going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We havent felt so insecure that weve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. Its been a good instinct. And were the most religious people on Earth.

I dont know the answer to when life begins. And its not that simple, either. Youve got another life involved. And if its rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If its incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It wont work.

Now, Im not capable, and I dont think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that thats where the effort should be directed — to make that determination. I dont think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self- defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that were talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldnt it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?

Im all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I dont agree with it. Since Ive got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.

Fred Barnes,"Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle- class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, Im talking not about the rich or the poor — I know your views on their taxes — but about families earning 25, 000 to 45, 000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70, 000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around. Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200, 000 a year got $60, 000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30, 000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. Thats why my proposal protects everybody from $25, 000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70, 000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. Hes one of the wealthiest Americans, and hes our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12. 8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And thats why Ive proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people whove already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Fred Barnes,"It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25, 000 to 45, 000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25, 000 to 35, 000, their tax rate would go up — their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35, 000 to 45, 000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldnt that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Walter Mondale,"The first thing is, everybody 25, 000 and under would have no tax increase. Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said hes studying a sales tax or a value- added tax. Theyre the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate- income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched. Up until about $70, 000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, Id like to see the total repeal of indexing. I dont think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Fred Barnes,"Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle- income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"You know, I wasnt going to say this at all, but I cant help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I dont have a plan to tax — or increase taxes. Im not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; its that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people — this is why we had a 25- percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50, 000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage- wise as did those from 50, 000 down. From 50, 000 down, those people paid two- thirds of the taxes, and those people got two- thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of 77 — this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time — there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money — virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there — that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38, 000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 — theyre paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I dont think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesnt work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as Ive said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0
Fred Barnes,"I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than youve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that “Im not going to raise taxes. ” Is that what you meant to say, that you will not — that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Yes, I had used — “last resort” would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. I dont foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence Im not going to go for a tax. With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there — had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.

James Wieghart,"Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office. There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans — working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, theyre saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies. What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term? THE",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, some of those facts and figures just dont stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household — single women heads of household have — for the first time theres been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. Were spending a third more on all of the — well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before — 2, 300, 000 more are receiving them — even though we took 850, 000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half — one out of two of the full- time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low- interest college loans. We didnt think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7. 7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings — 7. 7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. I did avoid, Im afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didnt even feel the pain of the recession.

Walter Mondale,"Number one, weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed. Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities — through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I dont mind those enterprise zones; lets try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees, theyre not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which theyre found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them — for example, the disabled, who have no alternative — how theyre going to do better, I dont know. Now, we need a tight budget, but theres no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and theyre hurting. One final point if I might. Theres another part of the lopsided economy that were in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. Thats another reason to get the deficit down.",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Ronald Reagan,"Yes. The connection thats been made again between the deficit and the interest rates — there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter- Mondale budget that we inherited — that the interest rates came down from 21\1/2\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down. The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I dont think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that theyre anticipating or hope — expecting, not hoping, that maybe we dont have a control of inflation and its going to go back up again. Well, it isnt going to go back up.

I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why — energy prices and so on. Theres no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, whats called the real interest rates — the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled — and thats still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and its attributable to the deficit. Everybody — every economist, every businessman — believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers — Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long- term hopes for this economy.

What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with Americas problems. I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didnt like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.

And why I think it is outrageous — first of all, it isnt true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, “Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute? ” And I dont think that that should be a part of political dialog.

But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out- go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldnt work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and were going to continue on that same line.

In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits — there was nothing wrong with having deficits. Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.

Ronald Reagan,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked; “Are you better off than you were 4 years before? ” The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning. Now, maybe Im expected to ask that same question again. Im not going to, because I think that all of you — or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and havent caught up, they couldnt answer the way I would want them to — but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago. The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be “yes. ” I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job. But we now have an economy that, for the first time — well, lets put it this way; In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3. 7 percent. The first half of 84 its up 8\1/2\ percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent. Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3, 000 in these 4 years. In 1980 — or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8, 000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line. We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure. Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldnt leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today were well on our way to a 600- ship navy. We have 543 at present. We have — our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two- thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those. I think weve given the American people back their spirit. I think theres an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that were in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said; “We have it in our power to begin the world over again. ”",Pres,1984.0,1984-10-07,1.0

Isnt the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, youll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now — over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self- interest. I dont think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean- spirited. When we terminated 400, 000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability — confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I dont think thats what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe theres fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. Thats not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all- out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and were being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because weve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The Presidents record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, “We are great, but we can be greater. ” We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.

Unknown,"Good evening. Im Ruth Hinerfeld of the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Were pleased to be in Baltimore for the first of our 1980 Presidential Debates. The League is a non- partisan organization. Were presenting these debates to provide citizens an opportunity to see and hear the candidates state their positions on important issues of concern to us all. Our moderator is Bill Moyers. MOYERS, HOST AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, “BILL MOYERS JOURNAL, ” PUBLIC BROADCASTING",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Unknown,"Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld. My colleagues and I agreed to participate tonight, although the questioners are limited by the constraints of the format, because we thought with the League of Women Voters, that it is desirable to seek a comparison of views on a few issues in a joint appearance by the men who would be the next President of the United States. Former Governor Ronald Reagan, a Republican Party candidate, and Congressman John Anderson, who is running as an Independent, accepted the League of Women Voters invitation to be here. President Carter declined. Mr. Reagan and Mr. Anderson will respond with their views on certain issues posed by questions from my colleagues; Carol Loomis of Fortune Magazine; Daniel Greenberg, a syndicated columnist; Charles Corddry of the Baltimore Sun; Lee May of The Los Angeles Times; James Bryant Quinn. Jane Bryant Quinn of Newsweek; and Soma Golden of The New York Times. None of the questions has been submitted in advance to either the League of Women Voters, or to the candidates, or to their representatives. Gentlemen, thank you both for coming. The ground rules you agreed upon with the League are brief. Each panelist will ask a single question. You will have two and a half minutes in which to respond. After youve stated your positions in those two and a half minutes, each of you will have one minute and 15 seconds for response. At the close of the debate, each of you will have three minutes for closing remarks. We ask the Convention Center audience to abide by one simple ground rule; Please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate. You may do that on November 4. Having won the toss of the coin, Mr. Anderson will respond to the first question from Carol Loomis. CAROL LOOMIS, BOARD OF EDITORS, FORTUNE",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Unknown,"Mr. Anderson, opinion polls show that the American public sees inflation as the countrys number one economic problem, yet, as individuals, they oppose cures that hurt them personally. Elected officials have played along by promising to cure inflation while backing away from tough programs that might hurt one special interest group or another, and by actually adding inflationary elements to the system, such as indexing. They have gone for what is politically popular, rather than for what might work and amount to leadership. My question, and please be specific, is what politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with, that might provide real progress in reducing inflation? REP. JOHN B.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Miss Loomis, I think its very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign 80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight – 221 million Americans – are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years. Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend. But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me. Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across- the- board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27. 5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter. I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year – and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion – that that simply would be irresponsible. That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation. Even though weve seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, weve also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry. What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11. 3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. I think weve got to have fiscal restraint. And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees. That we ought to … in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion. In other words… .",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Carol Loomis,"Governor Reagan, repeating the question, and I would ask you, again, to engage in as many specifics as you possibly can. What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation? GOV. RONALD",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing- press money in excessive amounts, youre causing inflation. And it isnt really higher prices, its just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed – and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased- in tax cut over a three- year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology – all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations – produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isnt here tonight. But I dont see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isnt inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, were only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built- in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $. 80, has gone up to about $1. 30. In other words, weve had a huge increase of about $. 50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country – or much of it – into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti- inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Bill Moyers,Mr. Reagan.,Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, I cannot see where a $. 50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $. 50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then were asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if youre going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0
Bill Moyers,"The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg. GREENBERG, SYNDICATED",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Unknown,"Well, gentlemen, what Id like to say first is, I think the panel and the audience would appreciate responsiveness to the questions, rather than repetitions of your campaign addresses. My question for the Governor is; Every serious examination of the future supply of energy and other essential resources – including air, land and water – finds that we face shortages and skyrocketing prices, and that, in many ways, were pushing the environment to dangerous limits. Id like to know, specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and general consumption, to meet problems that arent going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and Im for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all youre doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in todays oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the worlds coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy- rich nation.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0
Bill Moyers,"I would like to say at this point that the candidates requested the same questions to be repeated, for the sake of precision, on the part of the interrogator. So, Mr. Greenberg, you may address Mr. Anderson.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Daniel Greenberg,"Mr. Anderson, Id like to know specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and consumption, to meet problems that arent going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years supply of natural gas, 47 years supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and thats going to be enough. I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and thats simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think its going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. Were going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy- efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago – the Harvard Business School study – indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Ronald Reagan,"Well, as Ive said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldnt be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people havent been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, were producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0
Bill Moyers,Mr. Anderson.,Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact. And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though its true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation – I think that a change in lifestyles – is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Bill Moyers,"This question goes to you, Mr. Anderson, from Charles Corddry. CHARLES CORDDRY, MILITARY CORRESPONDENT, THE SUN,",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Unknown,"Mr. Anderson, you and Mr. Reagan both speak for better defense. for stronger defense and for programs that would mean spending more money. You do not, either of you, however, come to grips with the fundamental problem of manning the forces, of who shall serve, and how the burden will be distributed. This will surely be a critical issue in the next Presidential term. You both oppose the draft. The questions are, how would you fill the under- strength combat forces with numbers and quality, without reviving conscription? And will you commit yourself, here, tonight, should you become the Commander in Chief, to propose a draft, however unpopular, if it becomes clear that voluntary means are not working?",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country – Continental United States Army Divisions – simply could not pass a readiness test; that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so- called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 – this very month – that there is a shortage of about 104, 000 in the ranks between E- 4 and E- 9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25, 000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all- volunteer Army was created in 1973 – and I worked hard for it and supported it – we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% – and I happen to think thats a very modest estimate – 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think thats shocking; its shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention – when I spoke to each of those bodies – I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense. But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question; that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Ronald Reagan,"Mr. Corddry, its a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non- commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldnt have the non- commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and were asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and hes earning less for himself and his family, while hes away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid – 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G. I. Bill of Rights – the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if were going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heavens sakes, lets go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that were asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million- man active reserve that could be called up on an instants notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just – Ill hasten – I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Mr. Moyers. I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money. We signed one bill. or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million – a half a billion dollars. That is just a downpayment, in my opinion. But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. Ive just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30- year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs – not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on – when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion. I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Ronald Reagan,"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But thats not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. Hes talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now hes decided itll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, Id say that that high school class in a military training – 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

The mayors that Ive talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local governments hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why dont we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy- five percent of the people live in the cities. I dont know of a city in America that doesnt have the kind of problems youre talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, lets say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldnt it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and Ive believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isnt getting a tax now from businesses there because they arent there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why dont we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs – give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. Weve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it – just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country – urban . or country homesteading.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America – the large cities of this country – are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. Im happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson- Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question – to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh – I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign – the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasnt money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and weve told you where the money is coming from. Its going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re- employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion- dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Bill Moyers,"Mr. Reagan, your response.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments – Federal, State and Local – taking $. 44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre- empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, its because the Federal Government has pre- empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesnt make money. It just takes – from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi- billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed- out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, theyve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage – with the tax incentive – the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating? It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing; To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country. We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. And why is that? Its because they have lost their industry. And why have they lost their industry? Its because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there. I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Bill Moyers,"Jane Bryant Quinn has the next question, for you, Mr. Anderson. JANE BRYANT QUINN, CBS NEWS/NEWSWEEK/WASHINGTON",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Washington Post,"Mr. Anderson, many voters are very worried that tax cuts, nice as they are, will actually add to inflation. And many eminent conservatives have testified that even business tax cuts, as you have proposed, can be inflationary as long as we have a budget deficit. Now, Mr. Reagan has mentioned that he put out a five- year economic forecast, which indeed he did, but it contained no inflation number. You have published a detailed program, but it too does not have any hard numbers on it about how these things work with inflation. So I would like to ask you, if you will commit to publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can absorb them and understand them and analyze them, showing exactly what al these problems youve mentioned tonight – on energy, on defense, on the cities – how these impact on inflation, and what inflations actually going to be over five years.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think its going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, weve seen what has happened. We havent gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we havent gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carters first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index – thats about 18% on an annualized basis – what its going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it “brutal economics. ” Ive been very careful – I have been very careful in saying that what Im going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, its gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20, 000- a- year income. Im going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that Ive talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption- oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Mr. Reagan, will you publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can have time to analyze and absorb them before the election, showing exactly what all these things youve discussed tonight – for energy, cities and defense – mean for inflation over the next five years?",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
Ronald Reagan,"Miss Quinn, I dont have to. Ive done it. We have a back- up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used – yes, we used – the Senate Budget Committees projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7. 5% – which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, Johns been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, weve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if youve got a kid thats extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non- inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state – California – 10% of the population of this nation – a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh- ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California – in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts – $5. 7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and thats what hes counting on for his plan. But hes going to get a half- a- trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that thats too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Mr. Moyers, Im not here to debate Governor Reagans record as Governor. This is 1980 and not 1966. But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4. 6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10. 2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesnt accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Ronald Reagan,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures. And John has just made up some very interesting figures. We took the Senate report, of course. But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesnt quite realize – hes never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if thats possible, of any executive job in America today – because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government – we only increased the size of Government one- twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

New York Times,"Id like to switch the focus from inflation to God. This week, Cardinal Medeiros of Boston warned Catholics that its sinful to vote for candidates who favor abortion. This did not defeat the two men he opposed, but it did raise questions about the roles of church and state. You. Mr. Reagan, have endorsed the participation of fundamentalist churches in your campaign. And you, Mr. Anderson, have tried three times to amend the Constitution to recognize the, quote, “law and authority, ” unquote, of Jesus Christ. My question; Do you approve of the Churchs actions this week in Boston?

Ronald Reagan,"Oh, Im its my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I dont think theres any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which weve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents – the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all – speak of man being created, of a Creator. That were a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Governments invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I wont take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.

Do you approve the Churchs action this week in Boston, and should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights and defense spending?",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0
John Anderson,"Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues. But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned – that specific case – to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges – that only judges that hold a certain, quote, “view, ” on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I dont believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I dont believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo- Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me – its a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice – in 1971 – I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, “Be sure to say a prayer before you start your days work. ” But I dont think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,0.0

Thats the one who is being aborted. And Ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks; Ive always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people – people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American – a proud, an independent. , and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. were confronted with the horrendous problems that weve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever- increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. Weve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, weve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. Im not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems weve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny – and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it.",Pres,1980.0,1980-09-21,1.0

John Anderson,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think youve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing – we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight – for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts; Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I dont think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. Its been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. Weve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore; atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we dont resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism – the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere – that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues – atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism – that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.

Questions will be put by Frank Reynolds of ABC News, James Gannon of the Wall Street Journal, and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker magazine. Under the agreed rules the first question will go to Governor Carter. That was decided by the toss of a coin. He will have up to three minutes to answer. One follow- up question will be permitted with up to two minutes to reply. President Ford will then have two minutes to respond. The next question will go to President Ford with the same time arrangements, and questions will continue to be alternated between the candidates.

Jimmy Carter,"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to – back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh – an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh – business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. Well never have uh – an end to the inflationary spiral, and well never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh – to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayers money – in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh – putting forward of uh – two- 0- two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the – in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our – uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high; sometimes among minority groups, or those who dont speak English, or whore black, or young people, or – 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah – cha- in – in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important – uh aspect of our – uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down – uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh – kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in – in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh – uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very – very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management – business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job – job – uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people – uh and also sharing with uh – local governments the uh – payment of salaries which would uh – let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh – of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh – 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about – uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

And I think this would uh – this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that – that would be necessary. I would not favor the uh – payment of uh – of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.

I notice particularly that he didnt endorse the Humphrey- Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh – we all know that it wouldve controlled our economy, it wouldve added uh – ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It wouldve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh – expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh – about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion – three- quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one- quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh – also uh – help our youths with some of the proposals that uh – would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.

Edwin Newman,"Mr. Gannon, your question to President Ford.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
James Gannon,"Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle- income Americans – even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut – three- quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures – a one- for- one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety- five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle- income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption – money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldnt have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can – with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh – about 11 percent per year. We cant afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half – a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one- half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that well get more revenue and well have a more prosperous economy.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
James Gannon,"Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh – the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh – sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh – since it doesnt meet your – your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have uh – added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. Im sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill – that hasnt reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two – its about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has – uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with – tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if theres more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that Ive made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh – justify my signature and my approval.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,"Governor Carter, your response.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford is – is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; its just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh – 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in – in August of 1974, the first thing he did in – in October was to ask for a $4. 7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh – since the great depression of nineteen uh – of the 1940s. In uh – January of 1975 he asked for a tax change; a $5. 6 billion increase on low- and- middle- income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh – December of uh – 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax- reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh – my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low- income people to take em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in – sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, weve had a reduction in uh – in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. Weve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us.

Youve also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term. Now you havent put a price tag on those programs, but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term, and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period, there still isnt enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any – any estimates that Ive been able to see. So, in that case what would give?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well, as a matter of fact there is. If we assume the ah – uh – a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the – the – the – uh wa uh – Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four- year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent – under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does – my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh – and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty- billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that – that if we see that these goals cannot be reached – and I believe theyre reasonable goals – then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh – these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then Ill phase in the programs that weve uh – advocated, more slowly.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Elizabeth Drew,"Governor, uh – according to the budget committees of the Congress tha- tha- tha- that you referred to, if we get to full employment – what they project at a 4 percent unemployment – and, as you say, even allowing for the inflation in the programs, there would not be anything more than a surplus of $5 billion by the end of ninet- by 1981. And conservative estimates of your programs would be that theyd be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars.

And uh – with that uh – in that framework would befit the – any improvements in the programs. Now this does not include uh – any uh – uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs. Uh – well have uh – a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do. The present bureaucratic structure of the – of the Federal Government is a mess. And if Im elected president thats gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change. And also, Im going to institute zero- based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh – assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if Im elected president. Keep my promises to the American people. And its just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh – a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Gerald Ford,"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break – a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief; I dont think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh – very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions thatve been taken uh – we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh – as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isnt going to be any $60 billion dividend. Ive heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.

Some fourteen thousand young men took advantage of your offer, but another ninety thousand did not. In granting the pardon to former President Nixon, sir, part of your rationale was to put Watergate behind us to – if I may quote you again – truly end our long national nightmare. Why does not the same rationale apply now, today, in our Bicentennial year, to the young men who resisted in Vietnam, and many of them still in exile abroad?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and – uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh – good record back. About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program. We gave them ample time. I am against- an across- the- board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters. Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the – the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. There was hatred, there was divisiveness – uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects. Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president. It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh – involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems. Mr. Nixon resigned. That is disgrace. The first President out of thirty- eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure. So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had – to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia – which were still plaguing us – it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Jimmy Carter,"Well I think its uh… very difficult for President Ford to uh – explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and – and uh – his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact – now- I dont advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. Theres a difference in my opinion – uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that – that you uh – that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether its right or wrong, youre forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for – for draft evaders. I think its accurate to say that in uh – two years ago when Mr. Nixon – Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh – excused as were – as were the uh – the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the – uh pardon or the amnesty of uh – those who evaded the draft, but – but whether or not our crime system is – is fair. Weve got a – a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime – the – the – the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and – and who have uh no influence – uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And – and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is – is what – uh – is a – is a major problem that addresses our – our leader and this is something that hasnt been addressed adequately by – by this administration.

That sounds, indeed, like a very deep cut in the federal government. But isnt it a fact that youre not really talking about fewer federal employees or less government spending, but rather that you are talking about reshaping the federal government, not making it smaller?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well, Ive been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia. When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions – uh some uh – fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred – uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy- eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a – a tremendous success. It hasnt been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and – and a clear assignment of responsibility and – and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if Im elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that – that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the – of the executive branch of government. We now have uh – a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on – on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh – in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaids in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The – the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh – just advocated uh – this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh – information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.

Uh – in your energy plan, you consolidate a number of a – agencies into one, or you would, but uh does that really change the overall?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"I cant say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh – our budget was – was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a – a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh – completely revised our prison system. We established eighty- four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh – at the federal government level. I – I accomplished this with s – substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh – we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a – was a uh – substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh – have got to do that at the federal government level. If we dont, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. Theres no way for our people now to understand what their government is. Theres no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to – as a governor – to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh – it would be of – of tremendous benefit in long- range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carters successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh – months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words – the present governor of Georgia – he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what weve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty- thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that Ive been president – some two years – we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty- five employees, so weve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.

But in the last uh – twenty- four months weve turned the economy around and weve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh – well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty- eight million people working in America today – the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think well have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesnt cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We – uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesnt cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh – do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh – in education we can have a slight increase – not a major increase. Its my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh – he approves of a $30 billion uh – expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time were spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I dont know where that money would come from. But as we look at the quality- of- life programs – jobs, health, education, crime, recreation – we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Elizabeth Drew,"Sir, in the next few years would you try to reduce the deficit, would you spend more money far these programs that you have just outlined, or would you, as you said earlier, return whatever surplus you got to the people in the form of tax relief?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"We feel that uh – with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality- of- life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978. We wont wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh – indicates. As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year. We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh – calendar year this year – something slightly under 6 percent. Employment will be up, revenues will be up. Well keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality- of- life programs which I think are needed and necessary. Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh – Governor Carter recommends. He endorses the Democratic uh – platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs. We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars – uhh maximum each year to the federal budget. Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief. We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Jimmy Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh – same attitude that the Republicans always take. In the last three months before an election, theyre always for the programs that they always fight the other three- and- one- half years. Uh – I remember when uh – Herbert Hoover was against uh – jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh – later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh – of Mr. Fords Administration and Mr. Nixons before his. Uh – we had last year a $65 billion deficit – the largest deficit in the history of our country – more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight- year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. Weve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Fords been in office two years, weve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. Weve also got uh – a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. Hes got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh – talking about more people at work – uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh – two years, it means that – that women and young people have had to go to work when they didnt want to because their fathers didnt make enough to pay the increased cost of uh – food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh – in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh – at the same time weve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business; weve had a negative growth in our – in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take- home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 – measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record thats there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesnt go.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Frank Reynolds,"Governor Carter, Id like to turn uh – to what we used to call the energy crisis. Yesterday a British uh – government commission on air pollution, but one headed by a nuclear physicist, recommended that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delayed in Britain as long as possible. Now this is a subject that is quite controversial among our own people and there seems to be a clear difference between you and the President on the use of nuclear power plants, which you say you would use as a last priority. Why, sir, are they unsafe?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well among my other experiences in the past, Ive – Ive been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field. I think I know the – the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy – uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh – the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh – in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now its permanent, its enormous, its growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. Weve got to have a – a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have – uh a realization that weve got uh about thirty- five years worth of oil left in the whole world. Were gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now weve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also its clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh – not cut out atomic power altogether. We cant afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core – below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh – power tightly sealed and a heavy – heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full- time uh – atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty- four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh – procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh – put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. Thats the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Frank Reynolds,"Well Governor, on that same subject, would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Yes, I would. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We uh – now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh – by giving uh – the lowest rates to the biggest users. We dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the uh – automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the uh – amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a – a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located. A lot of uh – very high quality, low- carbon coal, uh – low- sulfur coal is there, its where our employment is needed. Uh – this would – would help a great deal. So mandatory conservation measures – yes. Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve – yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to – to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh – Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles. And some major uh – uh – manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh – very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh – as much as 40 percent with the same out- product. These kinds of things uh – ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Gerald Ford,"Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January of uh – 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh – conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If youre going to increase domestic oil and gas production – and we have to – you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh – develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal – make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh – have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. Were going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh – under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh – very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh – nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards. I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

James Gannon,"Mr. President, Id like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment. You have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh – in development in the Democratic Congress – Democratic- controlled Congress. Yet at the same time the government is paying out, uh – I think it is $17 billion, perhaps $20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment. Why do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh – made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh – be made available. Each one of those jobs wouldve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty- eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. Weve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think its uh – also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh – added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity. Its my – my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make- work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
James Gannon,"Just to follow up, Mr. President; the – the Congress has just passed a three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill which would provide money for the public works jobs program that you earlier tried to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation. In light of the fact that uh – unemployment again is rising – or has in the past three months – I wonder if you have rethought that question at all; whether you would consider uh – allowing this program to be funded, or will you veto that money bill?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight. But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh – add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector – not make jobs, where the jobs really are. These make- work, temporary jobs – dead end as they are – are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people. I think its interesting to point out that uh – in the uh – two years that Ive been president Ive vetoed fifty- six bills. Congress has sustained forty- two vetoes. As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures. And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit. Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh – uh – this administration has had. And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has – that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion. Now he cant have it both ways. And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are – five out of six in this economy.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,Governor Carter.,Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford doesnt seem to put into perspective the fact that when – when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings. I was in uh – a city in uh – Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh – there were about four or five thousand people in the audience – it was on a – on a train trip. And I said, “How many uh – adults here are out of work? ” About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh – actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non- farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about – uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says hes learned how to match unemployment with inflation. Thats right. Weve got the highest inflation weve had in twenty- five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And weve got uh – the highest unemployment weve had uh – under Mr. Fords administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and – and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasnt saved $9 billion with his vetoes. Theres only been uh – a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a – a typical attitude that really causes havoc in peoples lives, and then its covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. Its a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And weve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon – per year. And eleven of em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden – he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Elizabeth Drew,"But unless youre willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments, or interest, or taxes, or capital gains, you cant really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size. So how are you gonna provide that tax relief that youre talking about?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system – as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace – ah of all the tax – benefits now, 25 percent of em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent – 53 to be exact – percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and weve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has – has advocated since hes been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income – not from labor – but from investments. Thats got to be changed. A few things that can be done; we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas – if they make a million dollars in profits overseas – they dont have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they dont pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and – and builds a shoe factory, they dont have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh – a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh – government about uh – $1. 4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations dont pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for em. Another one thats uh – thats very important is the uh – is the business deductions, uh – jet airplanes, uh – first class travel, the fifty- dollar martini lunch. The average working person cant – uh – cant take advantage of that, but the – the wealthier people – uh can. Uh – another system is where uhh – a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh – can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars – nine hundred mi- thousand dollars – that makes a million – and mark off a great amount of uh – of loss uh – through that procedure. Uh – there was one example, for instance, where uh – somebody uh – produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have – have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh – eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person cant do it. You cant hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Jimmy Carter,"Yes. You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion. Now you listed some things – the uh – deferral on foreign income as estimated; that would save about $500 million. DISC, you said, was about 1. 4 billion. uh – The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion. So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief – would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Jimmy Carter,"No, I wouldnt do away with all – uh business deductions. I think that would be a – a very serious mistake. But uh – if – if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes. And this is uh – the point of my first statistics that I gave you – that – that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years – fifty years – by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. These programs that I described to you earlier – the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh – they only apply to people in the $50 thousand- a- year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it. Its to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle- income families.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,President Ford.,Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"Governor Carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. In that interview uh – Governor Carter indicated that uh – he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle- income brackets or higher. Now if you uh – take the medium or middle- income taxpayer – thats about $14 thousand per person – uh – Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh – the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle- income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty- five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short- changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh – added to the minimum tax uh – provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle- income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty- five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty- eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty- five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty- six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh – $9 billion. And one final comment, uh – Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.

Frank Reynolds,"I suspect that uhh – we could continue on this tax argument for some time. But Id like to move on to another area. Mr. President, uh everybody seems to be running against Washington this year. And Id like to raise two coincidental events and ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country. The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr, after several months and many thousands of dollars, trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people. At the same time. the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years. Do you suppose, sir, that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe theres something wrong in Washington, and I dont mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"There is a considerable anti- Washington feeling throughout the country. But I think the feeling is misplaced. In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and weve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti- Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It – the next Congress will probably be the first billion- dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I dont think the American people are getting their moneys worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh – in the last uh – four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh – the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I dont see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti- Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. Theres some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. Thats where the problem is and I hope therell be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Frank Reynolds,"Mr. President, if I may follow up. Uh – I think youve made it plain that you take a dim view of the uh – majority in the Congress. Isnt it quite likely, sir, that you will have a Democratic Congress in the next session, if you are elected president? And hasnt the country uh – a right to ask whether you can get along with that Congress, or whether well have continued confrontation?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"Well, It seems to me that uh – we have a chance – the Republicans – to get a majority in the House of Representatives. We will make some gains in the United States Senate. So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh – work with that Congress. But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might. Supposing we had – had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and wed had uh – Governor Carter as President. He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of – he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government. I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government – a system of checks and balances. We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately weve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes. If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,Governor Carter.,Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"Well, its not a matter of uh – Republican and Democrat. Its a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh – Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh – Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and weve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. Weve had uh – Republican presidents before whove tried to run against a Democratic – uh Congress. And I dont think its uh – the Congress is Mr. Fords opponent; but if uh – if – if he insists that uh – that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which Im – have not been a part, then I think its only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that – that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And theres been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and thats not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh – misquoted an AP uh – news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle- income families and uh – that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh – correction, but he still insists uh – on repeating an erroneous statement.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,"President Ford, Governor Carter, we no longer have enough time for two complete sequences of questions. We have only about six minutes left for questions and answers. For that reason we will drop the follow- up questions at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the others answers. Uh – to the extent that you can, gentlemen, please keep your remarks brief. Mr. Gannon.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
James Gannon,"Governor Carter, one uh – important uh – part of the Governments economic policy uh – apparatus we havent talked about is the Federal Reserve Board. Id like to ask you something about what youve said and that is that uh – you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whose views are compatible with his own. Based on the record of the last few years, would you say that your views are compatible with those of Chairman Arthur Burns? And if not, would you seek his resignation if you are elected?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Jimmy Carter,"What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of em serve the same four – four years. The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws. The president can modify the uh – economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh – an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh – Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh – inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh – therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh – tried to increase the uh – the tax uh – payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations. I would have uh – done it opposite. I think the uh – problem shouldve been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh – put – put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison. But uh – Mr. Burns uh – in that respect made a very serious mistake. I would not wanna destroy the – the independence of the uh Federal Reserve – uh Board. But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at – at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents terms being uh – the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh – entity with uh – with independence subject only to the presidents veto.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0
Edwin Newman,"President Ford, your response.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As the result in the last uh – two years uh – we have had a responsible monetary policy. Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half. They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh – fiscal policy of the uh – executive and legislative branches of the government. It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh – party that was in power. Its important for our future uhh – economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh – separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Elizabeth Drew,"Uh Mr. President, the real problem with the FBI and, in fact, all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them. Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open- ended. Now, you have issued some executive orders, but weve learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and, in fact, the country in a great deal of trouble. One president may be a decent man, the next one might not be. So, what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies?",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,0.0
Gerald Ford,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government; the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others. Weve done that by executive order. Uhh – and I think uh – weve tightened it up; weve uh – straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesnt seem to me that its needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard. Uhh – I have recommended to the Congress, however – Im sure youre familiar with this – legislation that would uhh – make it uhh – very uhh – proper in – in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as Ive done, we have to do it by executive order. And Im glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh – uh – NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Jimmy Carter,"Well, tonight weve had a chance to talk a lot about the past. But I think its time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. Its a time for unity. Its a time to draw ourselves together; to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. Its time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And its a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh – not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well- managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government thats sensitive to our peoples needs – to those who are poor, who dont have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, whove been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, weve suffered because we havent had leadership in this administration. Weve got a government of stalemate. Weve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that weve known in the past. Its not the America that we have to have in the future. I dont claim to know all the answers. But Ive got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government – in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate – is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in – who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for – that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",Pres,1976.0,1976-09-23,1.0

Gerald Ford,"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that hes promised. A president cant be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday – for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nations history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nations history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.

For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. (Applause)",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Jim Lehrer,"Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I think weve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie – “Crocodile Dundee. ” And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isnt a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many- point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think were all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences. I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. Were providing that young woman with help. But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug- running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.

But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we dont understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, its a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, Ive outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.

I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.

I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what Im about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan- Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor – that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think its about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.

John Mashek,"Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Michael Dukakis,"Yes, Ive been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive thats balanced ten budgets in a row, Ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, Ive suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and we cant afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. Ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and Ive outlined those in detail. Secondly, weve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid to this country. Its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. Ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20- 25 billion a year, which is what weve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I dont understand about Mr. Bushs approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says hes against new taxes, although hes broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, hes going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics. (Laughter)",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

George H. W. Bush,"Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I dont quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. Its not going to cost the government money. Its going to increase revenues to the federal government, and its going to create jobs. So thats one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so lets kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits – economists on the East Coast and West think its good – it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

John Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time youve proposed this capital gains cut, youve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. Youve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I think its the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but weve got to get the Democrats – Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. Id like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line- item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy – we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is – its not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out – the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we – and the – actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isnt that were taking too little – from taxpayer – were spending too much still. And the formula Ive given you works, weve put it through a good economic model, weve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the – Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what Ive said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please lets learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Why thats more than the average teacher makes. Weve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.

George H. W. Bush,"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe thats the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people were talking about here. But weve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also – I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, “We cant make it. ” And I think then youre going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs – and this cost on his – is – was – I saw an estimate, Id love to know what he thinks, $35 – $40 billion – and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isnt any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. Its a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just dont want to mandate it and risk putting this – setting the recovery back.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Michael Dukakis,"Well, no, its no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who dont have a dime of health insurance and dont know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night. I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and cant let that son compete in sports and Little League, because hes afraid hes going to get hurt and he wont be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because theyre paying for those who arent. And I think its time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.

In – at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease. Now, Id like to now, sir, if – what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0

Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think its a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, dont you? It was in 1964 and thats what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and hes wrong now. (Applause)",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Michael Dukakis,"Let me say this about AIDS. Its the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency weve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where its appropriate and where its done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.

We cant simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. Im Chairman of the Presidents Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because theres a safety factor, but I think these things – and then also I am one who believes weve got to go the extra mile in clean – being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.

Now, thats a certain passion that in my view its misguided passion. He – we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, “I am a strong liberal Democrat” – August, 87. Then he said, “I am a card- carrying member of the ACLU. ” That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion.

Youve used the phrase “card carrying” so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that youve used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950s as less than patriotic. Id like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and whats the important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They dont like it when I say that he says hes a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. Ive seen it authoritatively written twice, and if Ive done him an injustice, and he didnt say it, Im very, very sorry. But I dont agree with a lot of – most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply dont want to see the ratings on movies. I dont want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X- rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I dont think theyre right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I dont want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I dont want to see “under God” come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I dont agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I dont agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think Im more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, Id have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. Im not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where hes coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe thats not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesnt matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And thats all Im trying to do, is put it in focus.

John Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nations homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals.

What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see – when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governors wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Bakers wife. This isnt government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough. And so I think that were on the right track. I dont see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And were on the track on this one. But – and I, look, mental – that was a little overstated it. Id say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And weve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Michael Dukakis,"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who dont have health insurance. The problem, Mr. Bush, is that youve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, youve have homeless families. We didnt have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. Weve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. Weve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. Thats an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But its going to take a president whos committed to housing, whos had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while Im all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply wont do. Weve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and Im prepared to do so.

John Mashek,"Governor, youve mentioned the American dream of home ownership, and its certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class, as youve said so frequently during the campaign. And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Michael Dukakis,"Well, I certainly hope not. And its all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isnt providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isnt it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something thats part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didnt sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non- profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, thats the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. Ive talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, cant do it all. We shouldnt expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, thats a choice we have to make, isnt it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because its so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, thats the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesnt do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. Its the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent. Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing is up. We are serving a million more families now. But were not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. Theyre half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, theyll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and well go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome – thank God for the United States on that one.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Michael Dukakis,"No, I dont think there is. There are two very different issues here, and theyve got to be dealt with separately. Im opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. Im also very tough on violent crime. And thats one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. Its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. Its one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7, 000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I dont favor abortion. I dont think its a good thing. I dont think most people do. The question is who makes the decision.

The federal program doesnt do that. No other state programs do that. And I favor the death penalty. I know its tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didnt want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.

Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mothers life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions. But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"I havent sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the – let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And its continuing to evolve, and its evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support – rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but its much clearer for me now. As Ive seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, Im for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Peter Jennings,"Mr. Vice President, Im struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. Theres an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan- Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs youre talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs Im talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and thats why Im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so its a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. Im for Head Start and moving that up. And Ive already made a proposal – and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I dont think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Its cut federal aid to education; its cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self- sufficient. Its taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and theyre still resisting. Thats the way you help people.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self- sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. Thats just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he cant play little league ball that he cant go out on the ball field because hes afraid hes going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I dont think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.

The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down. But heres the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened Im talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature– are putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. Were putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. Weve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence. And we can do it.

Michael Dukakis,"Of course not. Of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors- Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. Its not the length of your resume. Its your strength, its your values, its the quality of the people you pick. Its your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not youre in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didnt prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I dont believe that the fact youve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. Im ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.

Im simply not going to do that.

As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didnt hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. Weve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we dont need and cant afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make. Im for the Stealth, Im for the D- 5, Im for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. But I dont think we need these other systems. I dont think we need them to remain strong. Weve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and hes promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire. So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
George H. W. Bush,"What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open. Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think its fine to do business with them. And, so, Im encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. — what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off. And when they have a – they a – deals that are good for us, as China started to do– the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. Im not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place- one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I dont want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all Im suggesting is lets not be naÃ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid. Look at the INF treaty.

And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What were talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well- equipped, well- trained, well- maintained conventional forces. And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously. We have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ï€s and beyond. Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not. And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home. Lets not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.

Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Michael Dukakis,"No, theres been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, thats about a billion dollars a year. But I dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, Im for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War- Star Wars- we have to cut some place. â‰¤ He hasnt told us where. We know where theyre cutting. We know where youre cutting right now. Youre cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. Youre cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon wed have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who cant drive their tanks more than three- quarters of a mile, because they dont have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. Theyre supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they dont have enough fuel. You have to make choices. Were not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately- on Star Wars- in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13, 000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12, 000. So, weve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down. But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.

The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready. Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.

Peter Jennings,"Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, youve both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander- in- chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists. And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Michael Dukakis,"Peter, its one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. But if theres one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, its an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And thats the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do its an open invitation to others to do the same. Weve got to be tough on international terrorism. Weve got to treat it as international crime. Weve got to attack at all points, weve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that theyre working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism. Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.

Michael Dukakis,"Well, John, Im a man thats been a chief executive for ten years. Ive picked a lot of people. Ive picked cabinets. Ive named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they dont, they dont stick around very long. But I didnt pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr. President, thats wrong. We shouldnt do that. â‰¤ Thats the kind of Vice President I want. He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that hell be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And Im very very proud of that choice. And I didnt pick him because he agreed with me on everything. You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is Ive picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much. I doubt very much that Mr. Bushs selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test. (Applause)",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

Anne Groer,"Governor Dukakis, as many U. S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,0.0
Michael Dukakis,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and weve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently- which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, well destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesnt cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that its been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think its going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think its going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio- degradable plastics- plastic- gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de- icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I dont think theres anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",Pres,1988.0,1988-09-25,1.0

I want to expand our markets abroad and thats why Ive called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so Im optimistic about the agricultural economy. In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I dont want to see the banks let off the hook. I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.

I dont want to go back to malaise and misery index. And, so, opportunity. Keep America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. Weve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it. I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons. I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. Weve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing. And I do favor the death penalty.

Weve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. Im more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country. You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them. I believe in the American dream. Im a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America. With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families. Yes, its a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÏ€s not an insolvable problem. Its one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America thats strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because were true to our values. We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesnt hide. We compete. The best America. We invest.

Howard Smith,"Good evening. The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency. The candidates need no introduction. The Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. According to rules set by the candidates themselves, each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minutes duration and a closing statement of approximately three minutes duration. In between the candidates will answer, or comment upon answers to questions put by a panel of correspondents. In this, the first discussion in a series of four uh – joint appearances, the subject- matter has been agreed, will be restricted to internal or domestic American matters. And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F. Kennedy. SENATOR",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half- slave or half- free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half- slave or half- free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if were moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is; Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if were going to maintain our independence, and if were going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think were doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that were making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. Im not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel- mill capacity unused. Im not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means were able to sustain our defenses; it means were able to meet our commitments abroad. Im not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food – some of it rotting – even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I dont think were meeting our obligations toward these Americans. Im not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. Im not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part- time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. Im not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa – in charge of the largest union in the United States – still free. Im not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production – and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society – the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. Im not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born – and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities – he has about one- half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one- third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh – four times as much chance that hell be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I dont want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I dont at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty- five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty- five on an average Social Security check of about seventy- eight dollars a month, theyre not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I dont believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think thats the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. Its the only way that were going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think were going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how were doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is; Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack – attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think its time America started moving again.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. Were ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when youre in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G. N. P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that its six and nine- tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner; Lets look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has – has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Lets take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Lets take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Lets put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that theres been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But lets not put it there; lets put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. Whats the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isnt enough. A record is never something to stand on. Its something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are – is – are much – is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for – for whatever it is, whether its in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much youre spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two- tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than were presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine- tenths billion dollar a year more than were presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isnt a question of how much the federal government spends; it isnt a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this; Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Bob Fleming,"Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature. He has raised the question of leadership. On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. Ive been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh – government is comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh – what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which Ive discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty- five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is; which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Howard Smith,The next question; Mr. Novins.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Stuart Novins,"Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy- making. Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad – abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter- American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh – I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the Presidents Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it – I would not presume to – that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
John Kennedy,"Well, I would say in the latter that the – and thats what I found uh – somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh – Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration. You – Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh – forty- four and at the end of the war, and uh – difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition – 1946 when price controls were lifted – so its rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh – price stability uh – Im not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think its true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I dont think that uh – we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Charles Warren,"Uh – Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,Thats correct.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Charles Warren,"Id like to ask this; Its a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers. Lots of people, I think, dont understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter. Now, let me ask, sir, why cant the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory? If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesnt step in and buy up the surplus. Why this constant courting of the farmer?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh – then I think you would have complete uh – economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really dont – theyre not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs – a few large companies in many cases – and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh – surpluses – nine billion dollars worth. Weve had a uh – higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance – attempt effective production controls – so that we wont have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Bensons program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice Presidents speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I dont believe that its very much different from Mr. Bensons. I dont think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Bensons theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,"Mr. Nixon, comment? NIXON; I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh – with re- on the farm program. He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh – that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh – controls on acreage even far more than they have today. I think this is the wrong direction. I dont think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future. The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect. It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it. And thats the fundamental reason why we cant let the farmer go by himself at the present time. The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war. Now that we have these surpluses, its our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh – the surpluses. Until we get the surpluses off the farmers back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up. But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh – from the products which are in surplus.

Sander Vanocur,"Uh – Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, Id like to follow Mr. Novins question. Now, Republican campaign slogans – youll see them on signs around the country as you did last week – say its experience that counts – thats over a picture of yourself; sir uh – implying that youve had more governmental executive decision- making uh – experience than uh – your opponent. Now, in his news conference on August twenty- fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted. His reply was, and Im quoting; “If you give me a week I might think of one. I dont remember. ” Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasnt brought it up since, and Im wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct – the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh – if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark. Uh – I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh – the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody – including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isnt for me to say. Uh – I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedys is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Theres no certain road to the presidency. There are no guarantees that uh – if you take uh – one road or another that you will be a successful president. I have been in the Congress for fourteen years. I have voted in the last uh – eight years uh – and the Vice President was uh – presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.

John Kennedy,"I didnt indicate. I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I dont believe that youre going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty- one, two, or three.

Stuart Novins,– a reduction of the Federal debt.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"– reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow- down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty- four; which made the recession of fifty- eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that Ive talked about, in my judgment, are uh – fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program – the Javits- Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program – would have cost, if fully used uh – six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries. I think thats a good investment. I think were going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth – and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,"Mr. Nixon, your comment?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedys speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned – the one for medical care for the aged – that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay- as- you- go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development – which I also support, incidentally, however – whenever you uh – uh – in – in – uh – appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesnt mean that you – the government doesnt have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things; either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people – the older people – that weve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe thats the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Charles Warren,"Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education. Mr. Vice President, you said – it was back in 1957 – that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasnt corrected it could lead to a national disaster. And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers. I wonder if you could explain that, sir.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Im awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasnt able to complete the argument. Uh – I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh – pay teachers salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick- off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers salaries – at least thats the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason; we want higher teachers salaries. We need higher teachers salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty- four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,Senator Kennedys comment?,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"When uh – the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh – defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I dont want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh – the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs – and they should be carefully drawn – within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Now, in the August post- convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills.

Sander Vanocur,– if you werent able to get them in August?,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh – to provide a dollar twenty- five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two- thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty- five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it – nearly two- thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty- five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter – its extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one- third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight thats been going on for twenty- five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty- four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I dont see how its possible for a one- third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two- thirds, if the two- thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh – misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because lets consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues – the majority of those who were Democrats – why didnt they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh – without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Bob Fleming,"Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate? NIXON; I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate. Uh – We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh – in this election. We cannot, of course, control the Senate. I would say that a president will be able to lead – a president will be able to get his program through – to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people. Sometimes we – we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate its purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing. It isnt really that. Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it. And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress. Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedys proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh – a presidential veto stopping programs. You must always remember that a president cant stop anything unless he has the people behind him. And the reason President Eisenhowers vetoes have been sustained – the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed – is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Howard Smith,Senator Kennedy.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
John Kennedy,"Well, now lets look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty- five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I dont think thats extreme at all; and yet nearly two- thirds to three- fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It – it was a very uh – because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh – met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House – not one Republican – and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I dont say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars – Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didnt agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs.

Richard Nixon,"I agree with Senator Kennedys appraisal generally in this respect. The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and its waged right here in the United States. Thats why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh – we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh – the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh – would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.

Now, sir, isnt it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing? Uh – Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0
Richard Nixon,"Not at all. As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isnt the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all – individual enterprise – moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that weve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight- year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0
Howard Smith,Senator Kennedy.,Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,0.0

Secondly, I think we have a rich uh – country. And I think we have a powerful country. I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if were going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isnt enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what were doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.

Richard Nixon,"Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty- four per cent of our total gross national product. Thats the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh – out uh – out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program – the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported – is one that provides for all people over sixty- five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this; this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when – during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in – we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it – people on retired incomes uh – people on fixed incomes – we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man whos president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

John Kennedy,"The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty- four percent of ours. I must say that forty- four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I dont want to see the day when its sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy- five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think its a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety- four out of ninety- five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is; as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that weve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people – what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is; can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? Thats the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh – the tide could begin to run against us. And I dont want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. Thats the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think were ready to move. And it is to that great task, if were successful, that we will address ourselves.",Pres,1960.0,1960-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonights will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine- minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow- ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, “We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, ” end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And youre wondering, hows it going to affect me? Hows it going to affect my job? Hows it going to affect my house? Hows it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market — and when the market returns. Number three, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator McCain, two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I — Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why. Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in — certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while. But the point is — the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to — it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you — do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you — are you in favor of this plan?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So — so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that. But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st- century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Sure. But — but let me — let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today — and Im afraid on Wall Street — greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption — or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"Well, I think Senator McCains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis. I mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for Wall Street, but not whats good for Main Street. And there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place. And thats why its so important, as we solve this short- term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the — a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We havent been paying attention to them.

John McCain,"No, I — look, weve got to fix the system. Weve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D. C. , and in the Wall Street. So theres no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But weve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word “fundamental, ” are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out- of- control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork- barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork- barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D. C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Obama, two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me. But lets be clear; Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700, 000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to — wants to follow.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork- barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama its not a lot of money. But the point is that — you see, I hear this all the time. “Its only $18 billion. ” Do you know that its tripled in the last five years? Do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. Thats why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. Its a system thats got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the — one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didnt win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"I — I dont know where John is getting his figures. Lets just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Well — well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second- highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in — in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork- barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2, 000 — 2, 000 — look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork- barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5, 000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3, 500 to $7, 000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of “rich. ”",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"My definition — heres what I can tell the American people; 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250, 000, less than a quarter- million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem; There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5, 000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5, 000 tax credit. Heres the only problem; Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is — is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Lets give every American a choice; two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two — and let Americans choose whether they want the — the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.

Barack Obama,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel- efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just — a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some — some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Are you — what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the — because of the financial bailout cost?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have — as I said, weve let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point — the point is — the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return — particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations — we have to do away with cost- plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it. So we need to have fixed- cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"I saved the taxpayers $6. 8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because Ive been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that arent and eliminate them and well have to scrub every agency of government.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,Not willing to give that up?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesnt work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom — or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly thats just me opposing George Bushs wrong headed policies since Ive been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that Johns been railing about.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,Would you go for that?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"The problem with a spending freeze is youre using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesnt make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that dont like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700, 000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and Im proud of the work of the work that Ive done there along with Senator Clinton.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you — are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already — I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Theres no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only — Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"Well, I want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obamas health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"I just want to make this point, Jim. John, its been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that youre going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasnt happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4, 000 lives. We have seen 30, 000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. Thats the decision of the next president of the United States. Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.

But thats Senate inside baseball. But lets get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. And so John likes — John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.

I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win.

Barack Obama,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut — Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? Weve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we cant do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what Ive said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal — and by the way, Senator Obamas original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.

Jim Lehrer,"Afghanistan, lead — a new — a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan. (LAUGHTER) And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and its a — it picks up on a point thats already been made. Do you think more troops — more U. S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U. S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place — Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai. Number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Afghanistan, Senator McCain?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger. Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. Weve got to get the support of the people of — of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic) , has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20, 000 additional troops, from 32, 000 to 53, 000, and there needs to be more. So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Heres what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top- level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy. And, John, I — youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross- border attacks against U. S. troops. And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti- democratic. We had a 20th- century mindset that basically said, “Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator. ” And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. Thats going to change when Im president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"I — I dont think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand- new United States congressman, the one — the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right; Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia — then we had the first Gulf War. I supported — I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record — and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn — turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, “Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. ” He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, “I will — I will wear his bracelet with honor. ” And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, “But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything — promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. ” That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re- enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we dont want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasnt through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that — for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we wont come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Jim, let me just make a point. Ive got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant – from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph) , given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can “muddle through” Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when Im president, I will.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

But the important thing is — the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.

And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people – a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4, 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when Im president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator, what about talking?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph) , Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and were going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, theyve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldnt sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. Or whether it be Nixons trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, Ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre- conditions. Those pre- conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"So lets talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe. And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means “without preconditions. ” It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, “Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you. ” Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low- level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we havent done it, as in North Korea — let me just take one more example — in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them. And you know what happened? They went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re- engaged — because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And — and I just — so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he — you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain?

John McCain,"He said that there could be secretary- level and lower level meetings. Ive always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad. What Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a “stinking corpse, ” and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. This is dangerous. It isnt just naive; its dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag. We dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into. And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagans “trust, but verify, ” and certainly not sit down across the table from — without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, its just dangerous.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low- level talks. Nobodys been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position. When we talk about preconditions — and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions — the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.

Barack Obama,"Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six- party — or the six- point cease- fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st- century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th- century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15, 000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40, 000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

His first statement was, “Both sides ought to show restraint. ” Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro- dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik- run government. I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a “K, ” a “G, ” and a “B. ” And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the United States — will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease- fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is — this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, “Vladimir Putin, our president. ” It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and lets make sure that we — that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,You see any — do you have a major difference with what he just said?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is — is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro- dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the worlds oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off- shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean- coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we — we — weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the — the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long- term security — because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore… (CROSSTALK),Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, “proven. ” That wasnt proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War. We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesnt quite understand — or doesnt get it — that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq. The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Oh, theres no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone. In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent. In the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like — in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are — the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we cant provide health care to people who need it. We cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We havent adequately funded veterans care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and weve got — I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, “How can I get disability payments? Ive got post- traumatic stress disorder, and yet I cant get treatment. ” So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. Thats been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"Ive been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20- some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. And I — and I honestly dont believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion — aggression in Georgia, to his — you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is — shows to me that we — that — that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that Ill take care of them. And Ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them. And Ill take care of them. And they know that Ill take care of them. And thats going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I dont think I need any on- the- job training. Im ready to go at it right now.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. Thats where I get my name. And in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do — and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how were going to keep America safe — is to — to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that — that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.

Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonights will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine- minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow- ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, “We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, ” end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And youre wondering, hows it going to affect me? Hows it going to affect my job? Hows it going to affect my house? Hows it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market — and when the market returns. Number three, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator McCain, two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I — Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why. Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in — certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while. But the point is — the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to — it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you — do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you — are you in favor of this plan?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So — so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that. But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st- century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Sure. But — but let me — let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today — and Im afraid on Wall Street — greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption — or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, I think Senator McCains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis. I mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for Wall Street, but not whats good for Main Street. And there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place. And thats why its so important, as we solve this short- term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the — a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"The — and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when theres a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, theyve got a little financial crisis going on. Theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We havent been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, its a classic example.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you dont, tell him what you disagree with.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"No, I — look, weve got to fix the system. Weve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D. C. , and in the Wall Street. So theres no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But weve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word “fundamental, ” are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out- of- control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork- barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork- barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D. C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Obama, two minutes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me. But lets be clear; Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700, 000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to — wants to follow.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork- barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama its not a lot of money. But the point is that — you see, I hear this all the time. “Its only $18 billion. ” Do you know that its tripled in the last five years? Do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. Thats why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. Its a system thats got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the — one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didnt win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"I — I dont know where John is getting his figures. Lets just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the — hes made it twice now, about your tax — your policies about tax cuts.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Well — well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second- highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in — in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork- barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2, 000 — 2, 000 — look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork- barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5, 000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3, 500 to $7, 000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of “rich. ”",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,All right.,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"My definition — heres what I can tell the American people; 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250, 000, less than a quarter- million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem; There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5, 000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5, 000 tax credit. Heres the only problem; Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Youve got to look at our record. Youve got to look at our records. Thats the important thing. Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is — is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Lets give every American a choice; two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two — and let Americans choose whether they want the — the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42, 000 a year.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"Look, its just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John — this is undeniable — oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But heres the problem; If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And…",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Jim Lehrer,"All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue — the financial rescue thing that we started — started asking about. And what — and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is its going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel- efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just — a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some — some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Are you — what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the — because of the financial bailout cost?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have — as I said, weve let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point — the point is — the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return — particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations — we have to do away with cost- plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it. So we need to have fixed- cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"I saved the taxpayers $6. 8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because Ive been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that arent and eliminate them and well have to scrub every agency of government.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesnt work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom — or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly thats just me opposing George Bushs wrong headed policies since Ive been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that Johns been railing about.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesnt make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700, 000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.

Are you — are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already — I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Theres no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only — Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"Well, I want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obamas health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that youre going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasnt happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4, 000 lives. We have seen 30, 000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. Thats the decision of the next president of the United States. Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.

But thats Senate inside baseball. But lets get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. And so John likes — John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.

I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win.

Barack Obama,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut — Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? Weve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we cant do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what Ive said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

(LAUGHTER) And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and its a — it picks up on a point thats already been made. Do you think more troops — more U. S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U. S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place — Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai. Number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Afghanistan, Senator McCain?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger. Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. Weve got to get the support of the people of — of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic) , has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20, 000 additional troops, from 32, 000 to 53, 000, and there needs to be more. So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Heres what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top- level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy. And, John, I — youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross- border attacks against U. S. troops. And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti- democratic. We had a 20th- century mindset that basically said, “Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator. ” And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. Thats going to change when Im president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"I — I dont think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand- new United States congressman, the one — the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right; Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia — then we had the first Gulf War. I supported — I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record — and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn — turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, “Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. ” He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, “I will — I will wear his bracelet with honor. ” And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, “But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything — promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. ” That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re- enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we dont want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasnt through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that — for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we wont come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Jim, let me just make a point. Ive got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant – from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph) , given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can “muddle through” Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban.

But the important thing is — the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.

And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people – a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4, 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when Im president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator, what about talking?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph) , Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and were going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, theyve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldnt sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. Or whether it be Nixons trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, Ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre- conditions. Those pre- conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"So lets talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe. And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means “without preconditions. ” It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, “Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you. ” Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low- level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we havent done it, as in North Korea — let me just take one more example — in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them. And you know what happened? They went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re- engaged — because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And — and I just — so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he — you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain?

What Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a “stinking corpse, ” and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. This is dangerous. It isnt just naive; its dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag. We dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into. And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagans “trust, but verify, ” and certainly not sit down across the table from — without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, its just dangerous.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

When we talk about preconditions — and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions — the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.

Barack Obama,"Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six- party — or the six- point cease- fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st- century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th- century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15, 000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40, 000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the United States of America?

His first statement was, “Both sides ought to show restraint. ” Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro- dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik- run government. I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a “K, ” a “G, ” and a “B. ” And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the United States — will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease- fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is — this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, “Vladimir Putin, our president. ” It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and lets make sure that we — that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,You see any — do you have a major difference with what he just said?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is — is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro- dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the worlds oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off- shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean- coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we — we — weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,… I supported Nunn- Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didnt. That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Barack Obama,"All right, fair enough. Lets move on. Youve got one more energy — youve got one more question.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"This is the last — last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain. What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11- type attack on the continental United States?",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"I think its much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Two minutes, Senator Obama.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the — the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long- term security — because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,Do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore… (CROSSTALK),Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
John McCain,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, “proven. ” That wasnt proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War. We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesnt quite understand — or doesnt get it — that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq. The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Jim Lehrer,You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?,Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,0.0
Barack Obama,"Oh, theres no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone. In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent. In the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like — in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are — the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we cant provide health care to people who need it. We cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We havent adequately funded veterans care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and weve got — I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, “How can I get disability payments? Ive got post- traumatic stress disorder, and yet I cant get treatment. ” So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. Thats been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
John McCain,"Ive been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20- some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. And I — and I honestly dont believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion — aggression in Georgia, to his — you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is — shows to me that we — that — that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that Ill take care of them. And Ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them. And Ill take care of them. And they know that Ill take care of them. And thats going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I dont think I need any on- the- job training. Im ready to go at it right now.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0
Barack Obama,"Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. Thats where I get my name. And in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do — and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how were going to keep America safe — is to — to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that — that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. And that is something that Im going to be committed to as president of the United States.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

John McCain,"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW- MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home. I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.",Pres,2008.0,2008-09-26,1.0

Lester Holt,"Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Im Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News. ” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonights format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90- minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. Well explore three topic areas tonight; Achieving prosperity; Americas direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead- off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, well have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates; Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [applause]",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0

Lester Holt,"Good luck to you. [applause] Well, I dont expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and were going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, lets begin. Were calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity. ” And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. Theres been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Hillary Clinton,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together. Today is my granddaughters second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for womens work. I also want to see more companies do profit- sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. Ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under. So lets have paid family leave, earned sick days. Lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt- free college. How are we going to do it? Were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, its good to be with you. Were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. Its about putting money— more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left— fired 1, 400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Hillary Clinton,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the worlds population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle- down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than weve ever had. I call it trumped- up trickle- down, because thats exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about whats best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and thats all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off well be and that everything will work out from there. I dont buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small- businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better well grow. Thats the kind of economy I want us to see again.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. Youve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Well, for one thing— and before we start on that— my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company thats worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our countrys in deep trouble. We dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. Theyre the best, the best ever at it. What theyre doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, theyre taking our jobs, theyre giving incentives, theyre doing things that, frankly, we dont do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. Were on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell in— automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement. Its been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians havent done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton— yes, is that ok? Good. I want you to be very happy. Its very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. Shes been doing this for 30 years. And why hasnt she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact…",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Let me interrupt just a moment, but…",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that weve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. Whats happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is— look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Back to the question, though. How do you bring back— specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Well, the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. Theyre leaving, and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, youre wrong. And once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what Im saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And thats a big, big factor.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Hillary Clinton,"Well, lets stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, “Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. ” Well, it did collapse.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Donald Trump,"Thats called business, by the way.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Hillary Clinton,"Nine million people— nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what Ive proposed and looked at what Donalds proposed, and basically theyve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle- class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3. 5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. Theyve looked at my plans and theyve said, ok, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think its real.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Hillary Clinton,"And I think its important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And heres what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. Thats a lot of jobs; thats a lot of new economic activity. So Ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress weve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,Mr. Trump?,Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, Im a great believer in all forms of energy, but were putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You cant do what youre looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time theyve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt, and hes topped it. Hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven- and- a- half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because theyre not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, theyre gone. And, Hillary, Id just ask you this. Youve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, youve been doing it, and now youre just starting to think of solutions.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and Ive said what Im going to do. Im going to have a special prosecutor. Were going to enforce the trade deals we have, and were going to hold people accountable.

Im getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, its not a tax— its really not a great thing for the wealthy. Its a great thing for the middle class. Its a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when theyre going to bring $2. 5 trillion back from overseas, where they cant bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton wont allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what— is so bad. So what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal to— and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together. Because we have— we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And heres the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2. 5 trillion. I happen to think its double that. Its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, youd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership.

If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. But thats the kind of thinking that our country needs.

You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit. So youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesnt want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Donald Trump,That makes me smart.,Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

And I think probably hes not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that hes trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they dont give you the tax rate. They dont give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns, because theres something hes hiding. And well guess. Well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to?

When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so theyre not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think its disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks its— really thinks its disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you dont learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, Im extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650— which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money. Its not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was— actually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3. 9 billion. And the $650 isnt even on that. But its not $650. Its much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would— if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. Its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our countrys a mess, you know, its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible— you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land— weve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and were a mess. We havent even started. And weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And its really a shame. And its politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Were a debtor nation. Were a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.

He provided a good middle- class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, youve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt.

Donald Trump,"So, yeah, I think— I do think its time. Look, its all words, its all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. Its an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnt get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Im running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thats what I do. But what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Ill give you an example. Were just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I dont get there one way, Im going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But were opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. Im a year ahead of schedule. And thats what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we dont have people that know what theyre doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"Well, were well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about Americas direction. And lets start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest its been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African- Americans by police, as weve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Hillary Clinton,"Well, youre right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system. Weve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And weve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. Ive laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that were seeing today.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words, and thats law and order. And we need law and order. If we dont have it, were not going to have a country. And when I look at whats going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country, whether its— I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long— we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just— just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very— I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, theyve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And Im saying, where is this? Is this a war- torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4, 000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over— almost 4, 000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, theyre illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be— we have to know what were doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African- American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Donald Trump,"No, youre wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against- police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where its allowed.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Donald Trump,"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldnt have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldnt be— when you have 3, 000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4, 000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop- and- frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You dont have good community relations in Chicago. Its terrible. I have property there. Its terrible whats going on in Chicago. But when you look— and Chicagos not the only— you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, its not good. But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So theres some bad things going on. Some really bad things.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Donald Trump,Ugh.,Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Hillary Clinton,"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. Theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop- and- frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one- half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just dont want to see it creep back up. Weve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African- American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And its just a fact that if youre a young African- American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say— we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. Im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now— and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby— right now, weve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If youre too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Hillary Clinton,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. Ive met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit its an issue. Theyve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Donald Trump,"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no- fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which Im very proud of. These are very, very good people, and theyre protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no- fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnt be on there, well help them, well help them legally, well help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super- predator about young black youth. And thats a term that I think was a— its— its been horribly met, as you know. I think youve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop- and- frisk, you know, youre talking about taking guns away. Well, Im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I dont think— I really dont think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe theres a political reason why you cant say it, but I really dont believe— in New York City, stop- and- frisk, we had 2, 200 murders, and stop- and- frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. Its hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2, 200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop- and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But lets also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.

Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.

[laughter] And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it cant be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African- Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention; When they go low, we go high.

Donald Trump,"I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesnt work that way. You were after him, you were trying to— you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I dont think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work. It really doesnt. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country— it was a federal lawsuit— were sued. We settled the suit with zero— with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I dont do on you. Maybe Im trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look— I look at that, and I say, isnt that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things. Ill go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And its a tremendously successful club. And Im so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.

Hillary Clinton,"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly were facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. Theres no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donalds very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really… [crosstalk] … tough, long game here. And one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear— whether its Russia, China, Iran or anybody else— the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private- sector information or our public- sector information. And were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think theyve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.

That just happened, and many more are coming. And Im very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed— 16, 500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, Ill take the admirals and Ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. ok? Because look at the mess that were in. Look at the mess that were in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps were not. I dont think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. Shes saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I dont— maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok? You dont know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. Thats what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under President Obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyre beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is— it is a huge problem. I have a son. Hes 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, its unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe its hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thats true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Hillary Clinton,"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. Were making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And were hoping that within the year well be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because weve got to defeat ISIS, and weve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0
Lester Holt,"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. Ill ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,0.0
Donald Trump,"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. “We will take out ISIS. ” Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out— what, they shouldnt have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10, 000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them. Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil— and we should have taken the oil— ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil— a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Hillary Clinton,"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. But the larger point— and he says this constantly— is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then- Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But lets talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? Thats the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think weve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So weve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means weve got to work more closely with our allies, and thats something that Donald has been very dismissive of. Were working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. Were working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. Theyre on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donalds rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

Donald Trump,"The secretary said very strongly about working with— weve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen. You look at the Middle East, its a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, Im a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, Ill tell you. I havent given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number two— and that bothers me, because we should be asking— were defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because— and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest— but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thats great. And I think we should get— because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Its a lot of money to protect other people. But Im all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And theyre going to do that. And that was— believe me— Im sure Im not going to get credit for it— but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.

You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this; An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time its ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasnt enough. So I spent a year- and- a- half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot. Thats diplomacy. Thats coalition- building. Thats working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, Id blow them out of the water and start another war. Thats not good judgment.",Pres,2016.0,2016-09-26,1.0

But Russia has been expanding their— they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B- 52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not— we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1. 7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.

Theres no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, Id rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If hes going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.

Jim Lehrer,"Good evening from the University of Miami Convocation Center in Coral Gables, Florida. Im Jim Lehrer of “The NewsHour” on PBS. And I welcome you to the first of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them. The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security, but the specific subjects were chosen by me, the questions were composed by me, the candidates have not been told what they are, nor has anyone else. For each question there can only be a two- minute response, a 90- second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means times up. There is also a backup buzzer system if needed. Candidates may not direct a question to each other. There will be two- minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they will remain absolutely silent for the next 90 minutes, except for now, when they join me in welcoming President Bush and Senator Kerry. (APPLAUSE)",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
Jim Lehrer,"Good evening, Mr. President, Senator Kerry. As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, Senator Kerry. You have two minutes. Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11- type terrorist attack on the United States?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
John Kerry,"Yes, I do. But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. Youve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make American safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances. Ill never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances. This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and were now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think thats wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. All of these, and especially homeland security, which well talk about a little bit later.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

George W. Bush,"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, whove suffered a lot. September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi- pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy- five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know were after them. Weve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, youre equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A. Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, were pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President, two minutes. Do you believe the election of Senator Kerry on November the 2nd would increase the chances of the U. S. being hit by another 9/11- type terrorist attack?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
George W. Bush,"No, I dont believe its going to happen. I believe Im going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. Ive shown the American people I know how to lead. I have — I understand everybody in this country doesnt agree with the decisions Ive made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe. And thats how best it is to keep the peace. This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. And thats what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, thatll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty. And thats what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. Its a phenomenal statistic. That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty- one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, its tough. Its hard work. Its incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. Thats why theyre fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didnt. And theyre showing up in Iraq for the same reason. Theyre trying to defeat us. And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

John Kerry,"I believe in being strong and resolute and determined. And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim. And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. Im proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race; former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhowers son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father — all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal; Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didnt use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. Thats wrong.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry. “Colossal misjudgments. ” What colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
John Kerry,"Well, where do you want me to begin? First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didnt even want to do that. And it wasnt until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said youve got to go to the U. N. , that the president finally changed his mind — his campaign has a word for that — and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. “Last resort. ” Youve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, “I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. ” I dont believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost; $200 billion — $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and its in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the worlds opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so hes got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden — than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I dont think so.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Ninety- second response, Mr. President.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
George W. Bush,"My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president. I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harms way. Its the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didnt need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. They passed the resolution that said, “Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. ” I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasnt going to work. Thats kind of a pre- September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping wed turn away. But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action. We did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What about Senator Kerrys point, the comparison he drew between the priorities of going after Osama bin Laden and going after Saddam Hussein?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
George W. Bush,"Jim, weve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. Were facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, theyll strike anywhere, with any means. And thats why its essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. Thats why its essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that theres only one focus on the war on terror doesnt really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course were after Saddam Hussein — I mean bin Laden. Hes isolated. Seventy- five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer — the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison. Were making progress. But the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippines — weve got help — were helping them there to bring — to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. Thats why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. Weve got a plan to do so. And the main reason well succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. Hes a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesnt want U. S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. Were spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. Thats the plan for victory. And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
John Kerry,"The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq. And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You dont take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace. You dont send troops to war without the body armor that they need. Ive met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where theyre going out on the Internet to get the state- of- the- art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present. I think thats wrong. Humvees — 10, 000 out of 12, 000 Humvees that are over there arent armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they dont have the armament. This president just — I dont know if he sees whats really happened over there. But its getting worse by the day. More soldiers killed in June than before. More in July than June. More in August than July. More in September than in August. And now we see beheadings. And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and theyre blowing people up. And we dont have enough troops there.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

I dont see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. What message does that send our troops? What message does that send to our allies?

As president, what would you do, specifically, in addition to or differently to increase the homeland security of the United States than what President Bush is doing?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
John Kerry,"Jim, let me tell you exactly what Ill do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but were shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America. The president hasnt put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. Thats why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadnt done the work that ought to be done. The president — 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X- rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those arent my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut — and thats who gets it — long before we do, Im going to invest in homeland security and Im going to make sure were not cutting COPS programs in America and were fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didnt want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And theres an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. Thats a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union — former Soviet Union for 13 years. Im going to do it in four years. And were going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

George W. Bush,"I dont think we want to get to how hes going to pay for all these promises. Its like a huge tax gap. Anyway, thats for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money were spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. Weve got 1, 000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1, 000 on the northern border. Were modernizing our borders. We spent $3. 1 billion for fire and police, $3. 1 billion. Were doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. Theres a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, weve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. Were communicating better. Were going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The Patriot Act is vital — is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time. And the test is not whether youre spending more money. The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe? We didnt need that tax cut. America needed to be safe.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
George W. Bush,"Of course were doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. Thats my job. I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when Im in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us. Theres a lot of really good people working hard to do so. Its hard work. But, again, I want to tell the American people, were doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President. Two minutes. What criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U. S. troops home from Iraq?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
George W. Bush,"Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And thats what were doing. Weve got 100, 000 trained now, 125, 000 by the end of this year, 200, 000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. Well never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home — which I really want to do, but I dont want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because weve achieved an objective — is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is; When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that theyre on their way to, you know, a nation thats free; thats when. And I hope its as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines wont work. My opponent at one time said, “Well, get me elected, Ill have them out of there in six months. ” You cant do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, “Thank you for what youre doing. Were standing with you strong. Well give you all the equipment you need. And well get you home as soon as the missions done, because this is a vital mission. ” A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and thats essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

John Kerry,"Thank you, Jim. My message to the troops is also; Thank you for what theyre doing, but its also help is on the way. I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today. You know, its interesting. When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said; We need you. Youve got to help us over there. Now I believe theres a better way to do this. You know, the presidents father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didnt is, he said — he wrote in his book — because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. Thats exactly where we find ourselves today. Theres a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didnt guard the nuclear facilities. We didnt guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didnt guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.

John Kerry,"No, and they dont have to, providing we have the leadership that we put — that Im offering. I believe that we have to win this. The president and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, “We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. ” He didnt do any of those things. They didnt do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said youre going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, “Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. ” Thats what we have here. And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. Theyve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this president hasnt even held the kind of statesman- like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, hes done the opposite. He pushed them away. When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, “No, no, well go do this alone. ” To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, “If you werent with us in the war, dont bother applying for any construction. ” Thats not a way to invite people.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

You cant expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq. Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve. So whats the message going to be; “Please join us in Iraq. For a grand diversion. Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time? ” I know how these people think. I deal with them all the time.

I thought they would stay and fight, but they didnt. And now were fighting them now. And its hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is. But its necessary work. And Im optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. Im optimistic well achieve — I know we wont achieve if we send mixed signals. I know were not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.

Those are his words. Now, I would not. So what Im trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world. The truth is what good policy is based on. Its what leadership is based on. The president says that Im denigrating these troops. I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what theyve been willing to do. But you cant tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8, 300, and below that the four others are below 4, 000, and below that, there isnt anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. You cant tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started — it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others. Thats it. And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs. And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages.

Ive been — but Ill nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people. And Ill tell you exactly how. First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didnt exist. We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didnt. He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. They obviously didnt. He misled the American people when he said wed go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference. Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. Ive worked with those leaders the president talks about, Ive worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president. And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table. And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know — Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam. We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances.

I dont think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didnt have the judgment to be president.

Hed been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq. You know, its hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harms way. I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husbands sacrifice was noble and worthy. Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror. I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide. We must deal with threats before they fully materialize. And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom. Missy understood that. Thats what she told me her husband understood. So you say, “Was it worth it? ” Every life is precious. Thats what distinguishes us from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think its worth it, Jim.

John Kerry,"The time line that Ive set out — and again, I want to correct the president, because hes misled again this evening on what Ive said. I didnt say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that Ive set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesnt have long- term designs on it. As I understand it, were building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you dont guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, “Wow, maybe theyre interested in our oil. ” Now, the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. Youve got to show youre serious in that regard. But youve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement; The United States of America has no long- term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But thats how were going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they havent done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards. “Oops, we havent done the job. We have to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training? ”",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

You cant change the dynamics on the ground if youve criticized the brave leader of Iraq. One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet. Thats no way to treat somebody whos courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward. The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free. And I do. I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.

But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely well ever have to use troops. But a president must always be willing to use troops. It must — as a last resort. I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, “Let the inspectors work, or lets, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, ” he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. Theres just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And I would hope to never have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, weve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.

And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1, 000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains. With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didnt use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the worlds number one criminal and terrorist. They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. Thats the enemy that attacked us. Thats the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. Thats the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two- thirds of the country was a no- fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U. N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.

And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, “Here, let me show you the photos. ” And DeGaulle waved them off and said, “No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me. ” How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what weve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous — Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I dont know yet. But Ill tell you this; As president, Ill never take my eye off that ball. Ive been fighting for proliferation the entire time — anti- proliferation the entire time Ive been in the Congress. And weve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

George W. Bush,"Let me — Im not exactly sure what you mean, “passes the global test, ” you take preemptive action if you pass a global test. My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure. My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties. Let me tell you one thing I didnt sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion — the difference of opinions. And that is, I wouldnt join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial. And I wouldnt join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasnt a popular move. But its the right move not to join a foreign court that could — where our people could be prosecuted. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if its not in our best interest makes no sense. Im interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it. But Im not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, Mr. President. Do you believe that diplomacy and sanctions can resolve the nuclear problems with North Korea and Iran? Take them in any order you would like.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
George W. Bush,"North Korea, first, I do. Let me say — I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear- weapons- free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And Chinas a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, hes not only doing injustice to America, hed be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. Its not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. Thatâ€™s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five- nation coalition thats sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. Theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And weve got a good strategy.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

John Kerry,"With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they werent willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The president did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story; We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here. And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for two years, this administration didnt talk at all to North Korea. While they didnt talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this presidents watch. Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium. Thats what we caught him doing. Thats where he was breaking the agreement. Secondly, he said — my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran — weve already sanctioned Iran. We cant sanction them any more. There are sanctions in place on Iran. And finally, we were a party to the convention — to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0
Jim Lehrer,"New question, two minutes. Senator Kerry, you mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan. Fifty thousand people have already died in that area. More than a million are homeless. And its been labeled an act of ongoing genocide. Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops. Why not?",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,0.0
John Kerry,"Well, Ill tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran. Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is — one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today; people with stop- loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. Its a moral responsibility for us and the world.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

George W. Bush,"Back to Iran, just for a second. It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran. That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D. C. In terms of Darfur, I agree its genocide. And Colin Powell so stated. We have committed $200 million worth of aid. Were the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more over time to help. We were very much involved at the U. N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north- south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldnt be committing troops. We ought to be working with the African Union to do so — precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives. And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long- suffering people there.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning. I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate. Although Im not so sure I admire the record. I wont hold it against him that he went to Yale. Theres nothing wrong with that. My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, Ive been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And thats my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U. S. president.

Its one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong. Its another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.

John Kerry,"Nuclear proliferation. Nuclear proliferation. Theres some 600- plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, itll take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago — six, seven years ago — called “The New War, ” which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you cant cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker- busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesnt make sense. You talk about mixed messages. Were telling other people, “You cant have nuclear weapons, ” but were pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president. Im going to shut that program down, and were going to make it clear to the world were serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And were going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And were going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty. Its our generations equivalent. And I intend to get it done.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

George W. Bush,"Actually, weve increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since Ive been the president. Secondly, weve set up whats called the — well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network. And thats why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi- prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started whats called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans- shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And weve been effective. We busted the A. Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. Its a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. Ill tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses. And weve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. Well be implementing a missile- defense system relatively quickly.

I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, hes sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesnt believe in checks and balances, and I told him that. I mean, hes also a strong ally in the war on terror. He is — listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids. Thats the nature of the enemy, by the way. Thats why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice. Thats precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well. Ive got a good relation with Vladimir. And its important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes. I found that, in this world, that its important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, youre able to disagree in a way that is effective. And so Ive told him my opinion. I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices. And I think its very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.

John Kerry,"Well, let me just say quickly that Ive had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation. And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them. It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make. I regret whats happened in these past months. And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail. And I think its very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us. We want a partnership. But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, “Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now. ” Now, Id like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks. Because thats one of the most critical issues here; North Korea. Just because the president says it cant be done, that youd lose China, doesnt mean it cant be done. I mean, this is the president who said “There were weapons of mass destruction, ” said “Mission accomplished, ” said we could fight the war on the cheap — none of which were true. We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il. And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China. Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.",Pres,2004.0,2004-09-30,1.0

But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.

But I have a difference with this president. I believe when were strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. Im not talking about leaving. Im talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. Thats the country that Im going to fight for.

From the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format, six roughly 15- minute segments with two- minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0

Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night. So let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right and make the argument you make, and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, on the first segment you go first. Two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply we won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all; top, top academic. Good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all; said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we just - - we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. If they had - - the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election. So they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse also. Definitely it would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Joe Biden,"I - - the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. And that say occurs when they vote for a - - United States senators and when they vote for the president of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted, and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is. Because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is the president has made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that, and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance - - health insurance now, if it - - if they - - if it goes into court. And - - and the justice - - and I have nothing - - I'm not opposed to the justice, as she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went into the bench - - which is her right - - that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing that's on the court - - and if it's struck down, what happens. Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held - - pay more money because she has a pre- existing condition, a pregnancy. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Joe Biden,"We're able - - they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man did - - gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre- existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well, those pre- existing conditions; insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.

Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for period of time but a president is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So, we have the Senate, we have president - - ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Joe Biden,He sends out wishful thinking. He has executive orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He has been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about.

Chris Wallace,"All right. I have one final question for you, Mr. Vice President. If Senate Republicans - - we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here. If Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You called this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the president; it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress.

Joe Biden,"Whatever the position I take on that, that will become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're in voting now.

Chris Wallace,"All right, the second subject is COVID- 19, which is an awfully serious subject so let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than 7 million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200, 000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you, is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes it to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Joe Biden,"Good luck. Two hundred thousand dead. As you said, more than 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5 percent - - we're 4 percent of the world's population - - 20 percent of the deaths. Forty thousand people a day or contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1, 000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said it is what it is. Well, it is what it is, because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning about it because he didn't want to panic and the American people. You don't panic; he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he - - we were insisting that the - - the - - the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing - - he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Joe Biden,"I laid out back in March exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools, it cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and out of the sand trap and your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.

It should've never happened. They stopped it from  going in, but it was China's fault. And by the way when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China, you don't know how many people died in Russia, you don't know how many people died in India - - they don't exactly give you straight counts, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said he's xenophobic; he's a racist and he's xenophobic because you didn't think ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governor - - oh, really? Go take a look. Their governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, "" President Trump did a phenomenal job. "" We did. We got the gowns; we got the masks; we made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job - - and that's because of the fake news. No matter what you say to them, they give you bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press; they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just tell you something - - I don't care; I've gotten used to it - - but I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood.

Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government's own top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public.

That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the - - he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. You know, a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat- run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week - - you saw that - - we're going to up on November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands. They can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look - - and these governors are under siege - - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you've got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs, it's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it.

Donald Trump,He does plenty. ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Chris Wallace,"No, less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice President Biden, you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago when he talked about "" very fine people on both sides"" was what directly led you to launch this run for president. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Donald Trump,"Oh, yes, sure. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for Black Americans than any president with a possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Joe Biden,"It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we never accomplished it. But we've never walked away from it, like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people, close your eyes, remember what those people looked like coming out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing antisemitic bile, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed. And they asked the president what he thought. He said there were very fine people on both sides. No president has ever said anything like that. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Joe Biden,"Now, second point I'd make to you is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so you could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wanted to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, you talk about helping African- Americans, one in 1, 000 African- Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African- Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African- Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did, and what he did has been disastrous for the African- American community. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Donald Trump,So ,Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Chris Wallace,"No, sir; it's his two minutes. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Donald Trump,"So you did that and they called you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now that you have treated the African- American population, community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the - - and that's why if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time because they saw what you did. You call them super predators and you've called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have Ohio, I have everybody. Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump. I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in half an hour but they won't do it because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at every place you want to look, Seattle. They heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order but you don't. The top ten cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats and in many cases, radical left, and they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to the point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. I tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Chris Wallace,"All right, I'm going to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury and the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, quote "" whether justice could be equally applied in America. "" do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Joe Biden,"Yes, there is. There is a systemic injustice in this country; in education, and work and - - and - - and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. The risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as president of the United States is call a - - together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers, the police chiefs and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency and when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to- - to - - to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable. And by the way, violence and response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protest is. Violence is never appropriate. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self- esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. They looked down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton. They looked down on people who don't have money. They looked down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together.

Chris Wallace,"There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly. And you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors.

Donald Trump,"I think it's a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago, where 53 people were shot and eight died - - shot; if you look at New York, where it's going up like nobody has ever seen anything.

There are as many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or to - - black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been at any time in the past. What's - - what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID - - they're dying in the suburbs; his failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded.

As a matter of fact, police - - the local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need, when they show up for a 911 call, to have someone with them as a psychologist or a psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn't go up, it went down.

Mr. Vice President, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable.

The greatest before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers. Everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way there was unity going to happen. People were calling me. For the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying it's time maybe. And then what happened? We got hit, but now we're building it back up again.

That is a record the likes of which very few people - and you know one of the reasons I'll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like you just don't do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president, you can't be a good vice president.

And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else; the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like leaves and everything else.

Donald Trump,"I think a lot of things do but I think to an extent yes - - I think to an extent yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call California is burning. California is burning. If that was cleaned - - if that were - - if you have forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live - - they have forest cities - - they're called forest cities. They maintain their forest, they manage their forest. I was with the head of major country. It's a forest city. He said, sir, we have trees that are far more - - they - - they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, you know, at some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burn to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Donald Trump,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old.

Chris Wallace,"All right. Vice President, I'd like to respond to the president's climate change record. But I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits. Not abolishing. But new limits on fracking, ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Joe Biden,"He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact when - - when our - - during our administration, the Recovery Act, I was able to - - I was in charge - - able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody is going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one is going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy - - number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500, 000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build an economy that, in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us , to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they, in fact, are weatherized in a way that, in fact, they'll - - they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There are so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that, in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no - - no relationship to - - with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest in Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More - - more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion and say, here's $20 billion, stop - - stop tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences or consequence. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Number two, we are going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time, and that polls stay open until the votes are counted.

I won that election and if you look at "" crooked"" Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup, they came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won and even before I won, from the day I came down the escalator with our first lady. They were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And, by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You had better take a look at that because we caught you, in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, ok, solicited is ok. You're soliciting, you're asking, they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited - - they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There is fraud, they found them in creeks, they found some with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent a two and a Democrat area, they sent out 1, 000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's a nice a nice come on November 3rd, you're watching and you see who won the election and I think we are going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done. But you know what, we won't know - - we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They are not losing 2 percent, 1 percent, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost by that. They are losing 30 percent, 40 percent. It's a fraud and it's a shame. And can you imagine, they say you have to have your ballot in by November 10th. November 10th. That means that's seven days after the election. In theory, should have been announced",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you're going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail- in voting is going to be a disaster. You say it's rigged. You said it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail- in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter of all the voters that either cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail- in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it, and are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any disputes? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Donald Trump,"I think I'm counting at them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don't think - - I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots, I think so. Because what's happening is incredible. I just heard - - I read today where at least 1 percent of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don't like them, we don't like them. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Donald Trump,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot where you're sending it in, sending it back and they are saying - - they have mailmen with lots - - did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailmen selling the ballots. They are being sold. They are being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Joe Biden,"Five states have had mail- in ballots for the last decade or more, five including two Republican states. You don't have to solicit the ballot, it's sent to you, it's sent to your home. What we're saying is, they're saying it has to be postmarked by the time - - by Election Day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes because ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Donald Trump,"Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
Chris Wallace,"No, excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem in fact over the years with mail- in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity where they missed the deadline. So the question I have come are you concerned that the Supreme Court, with a Justice Barrett, will settle any dispute? ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Joe Biden,"I'm concerned that any court will settle this because here's the deal, when you - - when you file - - when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to come if, in fact, you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not doubting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, said who they voted for, say it's you, that is totally legitimate. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,0.0
Donald Trump,"I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully. Because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today, there was a big problem. In Philadelphia they went in to watch. They were called poll watchers - - a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things. And I - - I am urging - - I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election. If it's a fair election ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Joe Biden,"Yes. And here's the deal. They count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And, by the way, our military, they've been voting by ballots for - - since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that's - - and that's what's going to happen. Why was it not - - why is it for them somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail- in ballots, that somehow it's a fraudulent process. ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0

Because, once the winner is declared, after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that will be the end of it. That will be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. If it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president not just for the Democrats, I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy ",Pres,2020.0,2020-09-29,1.0
