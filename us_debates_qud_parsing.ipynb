    "Statement: Well, as a matter of fact there is. If we assume the ah – uh – a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the – the – the – uh wa uh – Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four- year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent – under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does – my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh – and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty- billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that – that if we see that these goals cannot be reached – and I believe theyre reasonable goals – then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh – these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then Ill phase in the programs that weve uh – advocated, more slowly.\n",

    "Statement: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out- of- control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork- barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork- barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D. C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.\n",

    "Statement: Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is; for 40- some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right.\n",

    "Question: Why is it important for the United States to maintain its current level of defense spending and military presence in Europe?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement: Well, I think theyre serious. I think its a matter that we should continue to uh – give uh – great care and attention to. We should support uh – the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh – those who would destroy us from within. We should sustain uh – the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F. B. I. , and we should be continually alert. I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat. The major threat is external and will continue.\n",

Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases.\")"
